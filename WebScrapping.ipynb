Fuel consumption in city is around 10km when you drive reasonable, reduces to 8km for drivers requiring fast pickup.It is very good for highway, very good grip, very good pickup. Support overtaking, hard brakes etc., Fuel average on highway is around 12.5/13km for a fast driver like me.It is also good for hilly areas, I have tried and tested in two times from Karachi to Babusar Top,  its performance was excellent. Its 1.5L engine supports well on hills. Even its auto transmission is excellent and no issue on hills as well.only issue I had with this car was of ground clearance, which I initially got it corrected by putting spacers.\n",

Ideal for bachelors, or a very small / young family that just got started... Very powerful on the 4x4 scene, especially when offroading on LOW 4 selection. High revs make this car heavy on the economy (around 9 km/l - but different cars may vary on the mileage).I would however not recommend this where intercity travel (highways, motorways etc.) is required, for this vehicle is not intended for high speed / sustained driving. Also, watch out for oil issues in this car if the engine / seals etc. begin to drip over. I drove the 5 forward manual transmission, but felt at times it needed another gear... the engine is quite on the upside for its noise.A good experience overall, and value for money in shape of small SUV. A reasonable AC, powersteering and 4x4 ride.?\n",

            "Sporty exterior, a good evolution of design thanks to Honda's US design studio. The car gives the feel of a sportback, thanks to its coupe like roofline. This however, reduces head space in the rear for anyone who's 6 feet and over. Small details, like edges of the bonnet or the trunk or doors on some units are uneven and paint quality is average. which is better than toyota corolla where the quality of paint is pathetic. . And of course the extremely poor finish of the welds on the doors is very disappointing to see from a car that people are happily paying 2.5m to 3m. Because we don't raise our concerns over quality issues, our manufacturers happily rip us off by using poor materials to reduce cost.  The interior is very driver eccentric which is a good thing. Again, minor defects are present. The stitches on the seam of the seats are uneven, specially on rear seats. The car drives well but desperately needs its tires to be upgraded. Not a fan of CVT.\n",

            "I have owned this car for last 3 years now and bought it as a cheap stop gap. However it has worked so well that I plan to keep for another 2 years. Being an old model, expect considerable issues in Engine (especially if on CNG), door hinges and interior (if not well maintained by previous owner). All parts are relatively cheap and available. the only downside is that you must never put it in rough terrain. While shocks and suspension is really good on road, it can readily be damaged if harshly driven. The ride is reall smooth and comparable to 8th Generation.Fuel economy is so so. Car is giving my 9kmpl in CIty with AC and around 11 on highway with AC. Automatic gear box gives an observable jerk when shifting. At speed over 100, car is supersonic and you cant hear any engine sound at all.  Special care shall be taken of the Engine which is the most fragile part.\n",

The pearl paint gives it a shine that Suzuki can only dream of.  From the inside, among Japanese small cars, perhaps Nissan Dayz is more elegant, while local small car is far behind. It has amazing cabin space, rear seat drive is very comfortable, and all the modern auto features, locks, mirrors, windows, ABS, SRS airbags , traction control, radar, (beat that) are here. In terms of performance, the acceleration is low between 0-40 , as its 660cc, once up, it is as smooth as Vitz in 80-90 km/h range. The suspension is beautiful, giving a comfortable ride. Economy meter is available, inside the city it gives 22 w/o AC and 19km/liter with AC on a light foot. Price and parts are a bit expensive, but overall its luxury in economy.\n",

            "Stunning exterior with aero dynamic curves and sporty look make this car delectable to look at. Although it looks low in height but its ground clearance is fine.Interior: I would say it's not up to the mark, the cabin doesn't feel as silent as it should be. Cockpit and interior plastic doesn't look as good... As far as leg room goes, front has more than required and seats can be adjusted to accomodate rear passengers. Trunk space is ample for mid size family. Fuel economy is best among all cars except plug-in Hybrids. I drove it at 60 or below and got 35kmpl, what more can we expect from a 1500cc? Ride quality is very good, suspensions are soft enough to absorb minor road bumps and believe me it feels like a power monster. You push the throttle and there she reaches 120kmph in seconds.To epitomize: Quite spacious, comfortable, very efficient in terms of fuel and extremely powerful.

The options that was available in that car are not their in the latest cars (apart from expensive ones). This car is so comfortable that even the latest city and civic can't match it.

Engine is powerful and responsive. It can beat corolla 1.3 in a drag race. Suspension are smooth and same as corolla's. Easy to drive just like a small car. Great visibility from inside the car. Interior is good but plastic. Gives a feeling of cheap plastic. Abs and ebd helps driver steer in heavy braking and maintain control. The price is affordable 10 lac 50 thousand. Led tail lights. And factory fitted alloy rims and two front airbags. Resale is not that low. Spares are easily available. Engine is same of 1.3 vitz. Its a car worthy of buying instead of cultus or wagonr or any used or Jdm in this range.  satisfying than any other can in this range.\n",

            "Exterior looks a little bit classic from front and ugly from the back. Suspension in the back (leaf spring) are way to much stiff. They reduce the handling but increases its relaibility. Front suspension are satisfactory.AC is just the same as before the introduction of efi. Ac is not that good, might satisfy front passengers but not the one in the back seats. Ac sometimes work good at night but in day time, its perfomance decreases with time. Steering is a little bit light when one or two persons are in the car but above that the steering becomes hard. Although it has 39hp engine and Daihatsu Mira 2007 has 55hp but still i managed to beat it in a race with 3 people in Mehran. It has responsive engine but it isnt smooth and jerks when foot is lifted from the pedal. Dosent feel like a new car when you newly buy it and most of the time you regret it. Spares are easily available and its simple and easy to work. The car is v.much overpriced and should be avoided as it fails to satisfy\n",

            "Exterior is god looking. Interior is sleek with nice curves and modern look. Fuel efficiency is 14 in city and 17 on highway. Nice compact sedan with good leg room. Seats are soft and handling is easy. Drive is smooth. Ivtec boosts the engine after 3000 rpm. Its engine is soundless. AC chills even in hot summers. Power steering helps driver in traffic or rush conditions whereas ABS and EBD helps him to steer the car under heavy braking. Spares are not that much expensive and easily available at honda stores and local market too. Car dosent wobble at high speed due to stiff suspension. Speakers that come factory fitted are good with nice bass. Only thing thats bad is the cheap material used in the interior and front cabin pillers that block your view and becomes a blind spot. Rear Camera is also recomended. Air bags should be present for more safety. Body is light and can help it go from 0 to 100 in under 10 to 11 sec for 1.3l manual model.

This \"eagle-eye\" has it's own beauty.Interior is spacious and the driver view is very clear just like you are driving a compact car. I moved on this car from Mehran and not a single day I have problem driving this car in crowded traffic :)When your choice is luxury and comfort you will never compromise on anything else even fuel economy. If you want to enjoy the ride + mileage then you have to be very calculated. I rarely accelerate over 2500 rpm within city even on speedy route of Lahore canal road. Note 5th Gear + 3000 rpm can accelerate up to 100 km/h. With that driving habit, good quality petrol &  clean air filter can give you up to 13km/ltr within city. (Still depends upon usual traffic on your day to day drive route).Driving this car gives you feel of power and comfort.I've sold out this car and would call it my ex-love.\n",

I think we should brake the manoply of Suzuki and Toyota. My car was also driven by swift user, he says there is no difference in drive and comfort, only the difference is that swift is seen bigger and may be heavy. There is no difference at all in drive and comfort. It's milage is 16.3 on highway at the speed 85-100 (2200-2800rpm). And 10-12 on city roads.I am comfortable with this against Suzuki and other price range.It's best option than Wagon r and cultus. Even better than swift in price. Some people say about resale value, I think resale is second option first option is safty which any car maker not give in this price range. I think this car will make resale value very soon.

Its gives best fuel avg between 115 to 130 kph(unlike other cars). Trans is smooth n responds well. All four forward gears can be handled manualy. Acceleration is exelent. . It kicks to 160kph without resisting at all. Few bad things are it picks slight dirt on door poshish, carpet n door handles, bcuz of black color. Touch panel of infotainment screen is poor. Toyota quality control is poor. The rear lights..trunk and few plastic fittings are not properly alligned. Wheel are not balanced so if u take it out without balancing, u will not be able to cross 80kph. U might even find few scratches on body paint and even interior parts. Put ur foot down on toyota dealer and get these things fixed. Waranty remains in tact till u donot do any modification. Good deal for your money. Dont buy 1.3 auto unless u are above 55 age\n",

            "I was apprehensive of buying Suzuki due to its reputation and many people suggested second hand imported JDMs. Finally i played a gamble and went for Suzuki Swift Automatic. The first drive took me by surprise as i felt in total control of the vehicle. The stearing was light. The power was reasonable for an automatic. Excellent road grip. Nice interior. Suspension felt a bit stiff . The transmission is smooth. Then came the ugly part. I noticed periodic noise and some times grinding noise when i pressed hard on brakes. Took it to the dealer next day. They had to adjusted the brakes to eliminate the noise. This should not have happened to a new car. But anyway they provided excellent support and fixed the issue. I can also hear small rattles in left door panel. Other than that i am happy with the car's performance. Suzuki did a real good and surprising job. I was not expecting this level of satisfaction with swift. My advise to all the folks. Forget about old JDMs. Go for Swift.\n",

Everyone will agree BMW X3 is superior car and have more specs than HRV. I don't understand what Honda was considering while setting its price.  If this car has 1.8 Turbo engine, 18\" Alloy rim, AWD and Sunroof then it will worth about 3 million otherwise it will be failed car in Pakistan. I am afraid this will also be failed just like Honda CRV. They did same with CRV setting its price.

Fuel economy is approximately 9.5 to 10km/l with AC in city drive(for automatic version). Visibility is poor due to steep hood and broad pillars.

I drove it with 15km/l on motorway at 120kmph and  within city it gave me 12-13km/l which is not bad with A/C.As regards to suspension it is better than xli of same model and faaaar better than suzuki sedans.

The steering is also buttery smooth thanks to its electronic nature and the brakes seem responsive, even though they are not ABS.The exterior is okay. The front looks beautiful with the deer-eyed headlights. Fog lamps can be added to provide further beauty. However, the rear looks like a pathetic 'dabba' and it isn't streamlined at all. Fuel economy was good at 16-17 km/l in city traffic. The average dropped to 14-15 km/l with AC.One of the worst things I experienced with Wagon R is its instability at high speeds.; cross the 100 kph mark and the cabin begins to vibrate. Exceed 120 kph and the vibrations become unbearable to an extent that you have to slow down. I believe the cabin shake is a combination of faulty rims and the 'tall-boy' design.Wagon R's gearbox is a bit of a pain in the reverse gear but I think it will get better with time.\n",

            "I love my Dinkey. I am owner of Mehran Euro II VX 2012. The car is a sort of legend in itself, I bought it brand new and have yet to visit a mechanic in three years although I have really been abusing the car by being very rash to it. The car gives me a mileage of around 16 KM/ Liter in Lahore city: A city with choking traffic and then, it touches 100 really fast on petrol, can pull upto 130 on highways and can squeeze through thin traffic lanes. Also, I hit the car a few times and it cost me nothing: for one accident, I had to pull out Rs. 600 and for another just Rs. 800. its is simply a student/ young employee's best friend. It's so cheap to maintain and I, with a daily travel of 40KM, can go with Rs. 2,000 in case of CNG and around 3,500 in case of Petrol. It is awesome and then add to that very super resale and can be repaired fom a place right across your dhaba.\n",

After 200 KM i hear massive whistling sound from my tires and i take my car to service center. This time they conduct a test drive but they didn't hear any sound so they told me. No to worry, Drive this car for 1000km then we will check it. But if you hear any sound from tires and it still continue then visit service center and we will fix that problem.

Its with black bumpers and rear wash wiper. A smooth and aerodynamic shape. Considering the interior, Interior is not very attractive due to its knobs. The interior is full of old school designed knobs. As per features, it has only front power windows and rear windows are manual. Rear legroom is so small. Difficult for legs to relax. Although it's automatic the engine is very smooth and no knocking. If u want luxuries u can go for fielder. But if u want more luxuries it's the same example the more sugar more sweeter .It's a good car for Pakistan. The price range is 8-9 lacs\n",

I  moved from 2004 vitz to 2004 baleno to 2005 lancer , 2008 mira, 2007 march, 2009 boon/passo and couldn't satisfy my requirement.All of them had either power or economy but not both.Always kept looking for a perfect car  on pakwheels and Pakistan's market but couldn't find one until the Toyota Aqua started coming in the market and was seen on roads. Initially it was expensive but after almost two years the prices dropped from 20 lakhs to 15 lakhs. It's been two months that I have bought one. I love seeing it, driving it and usually forget when did I top up the tank. It gives 20-25 kpl with AC in local and without any compromise on power and fun factor. 650-700 in a 35 liter tank. Parts are easily available in local market . I forsee that it will take out vitz and 1.5 prius market.\n",

Leather quality is just fine while plenty of head room but not enough space for 5 people who are a little bit bulky. Leg room is good too.Now the performance is the area that impressed me. As compared to corolla, it has got some extra power. If you compare the two, you will feel this.But the bad side. It has got some hard suspension. Car seats are hard and hard suspension makes it worse. But the car does handle the curves better and gives you an in control feeling at motorway speeds.Fuel economy is pretty good. Getting almost 17 km/l on highway with ac with normal driving. Drops to 15 if I go harsh.Well I am very satisfied with this car.

            "I got a chance to drive this vehicle. one of my friend owned this. performance of vehicle is better due to Euro II engine. Fuel economy is also good. But seating capacity should  be at least 8. it is not helpful if with only 4 passengers on registration book. There is no cooling  or heating system in this vehicle. we can compare it with japanese used vans in price. But we can not compare it those vehicles in style and comfort. Suzuki  should take some bold and immediate steps in this regard.\n",

            "I bought Suzuki Liana 2012 model from Makkah Motors Karachi back in May 2015 as certified used car for PKR 950,000/- whereas Honda City and Toyota Corolla market price for 2012 model was above 13 lacs. So far it gives 10/11 km per lit in city and 14/15 km on highway. I have no idea of CNG as I have a petrol driven only version. Plus points:1- Comfortable Drive even more than City/Corolla2-Low-profile vehicle which suits for those who are likely to receive extortion slip (bhattay ki parchi) on keeping a high profile car. You can keep it if you reside in any disturbed area3-Chances of theft or snatching are really very low4-Insurance is less costly. Insurance company do require compulsory tracker like Toyota5-Parts are cheaper than city and also easily available6-Very smooth drive within and outside city7- It has electronic brakes and power windows unlike XLI8-SUZUKI 3S dealers are across the country Points to Ponder:1- Low resale value & high tax\n",

            "The exterior of this midrange SUV is quiet attractive. It looks like an SUV . No idea about the 2Wd model because I own a 4WD model. Its performance on Off roads is exceptional I have tried it no some pretty tough terrains it has never disappointed me, In fact it has surprised me many times. It does not have a low ratio gear as available in most SUVs but still you can manoeuvre it in some pretty tough road conditions. the fuel consumption is on a higher side if you compare it with a car. Its combined average is 8.5 to 11 km/L . Which is far better than any 4WD suvs in its class. Draw Backs: parts availability . Parts are difficult to find , but are available if you look hard enough. The 15000 CC with automatic gear is a bit smaller for this vehicle. It should have at least 18000 cc engine.\n",

Though the Speedometer is very decent with a blue background and the sound system is fantastic. They should have given leather seats instead of those carpet looking materials. Material used for the front deck, Dashboard and the doors is not good i must say. They are very sensitive. The front deck is made up of deck and gets very hot very efficiently. They didn't installed the Airbags which is pretty disappointing and even their are no Fog lights, no Rims, no LCD with navigation ( Which I had to install with a reverse cam ).

            "Exterior is beautiful. When compared with Honda city  or toyota vitz. Although some people will prefer vitz, i think this car's curves are more pleasing to the eye, than the angular lines of the new vitz.Interior is simple but not bad. The controls are light and easy to access from the left hand while driving. The interior is almost all plastic, which is  normal for cars in this price bracket.The engine is sufficiently powerful, with DOHC, 1328 cc and 90 bhp, it can easily break free from the highway traffic, or speed off a stop light. Higher RPMs are easily managed by the M13A engine.  The engine lacks VVT so fuel consumption is not a highlight, but the power output is basically linear and predictable. I sometimes felt the engine fell short on torque wih 110 Nm. In my opinion a torque output of 150 Nm would make it more pleasing to drive, especially when loaded and climbing. 5 MT is very smooth and shifts pleasurably, had no issues with it.\n",

I have taken this car to its limits i have drove it on dusty terrains, smooth roads, rainy roads, the car has performed extraordinary i never expected a car from Suzuki like this. I was thinking car like mehran or cultus which could get loosened up after 5k but it has performed good.. its throttle response, mileage (19-20km/l on long routes w/A.c, 17-18 within city w/A.C), grip, suspension has made to believe that Suzuki can make up good cars. i have speed it up to 160km/h (on favorable condition please do not replicate this speed because speed kills)i would also add up that there are pros and cons to every thing so here is the con of Wagon R: the stock tires are not that much wide which creates an impression that it may roll over on steep turns ( I have tried it on steep turns it does not rolled). i have kept it in stock condition and soon will be going for my wagon's 10k checkup.

The car was stable but 180 is too much , I wont advise any one to take that risk . :-) . Due to height of car i was so careful while driving it on wind areas , but it was cool . No need to worry at all , change your tyres to 175 70 13 as already mentioned in my review and enjoy the ride . The fuel economy is still going good getting 15 in city , 21 out of city with 3 RPM with AC . Wish if suzuki could upgrade it with an LCD , ABS and power rear windows,.

Seats are comfortable, great leg room for both the front and the back.Driving is smooth, although over time, the noise will increase, AC is top class, nice panel.

The interior is not totally noise less but the engine noise only comes in when it reaches over 4000 rpm. Now lets talk about the engine. The engine is powerful according to its CC. It gives quick and rapid acceleration with good high speed. Although it feels under power in second gear but it only feels under power under 2000 rpm, once it reaches at 2200 rpm, the engines give quick acceleration. The fuel economy is great. At starting it gave me 12 kmpl but now after 600 km it started giving me 13-14 kmpl in city with normal traffic. The brakes are great with great response and it stops me great control even at high speeds. My final words for this car is that it is great car and is totally worth buying.

It is a great car in terms of spacious and comfortable interior, soft suspensions, drives like a heavy / luxury / powerful sedan with an economy of above 19km/l. Interior tech is adequate with steering controls for bluetooth, radio controls, AC controls etc.Some of the drawbacks are as below:i) low clearance - you might need to add spacers in rear suspensions to avoid hitting speed breakers. I got it done from Khan Motors Korangi Rd Karachi for PKR 3000/-ii) Low re-sale. I just checked with a showroom guy (Khalid bin Waleed Rd Karachi) and he quoted 14.5 lacs for it whereas I bought it for 18.5 lacs one year back. But don't take these guys too seriously.iii) the engine on/off shudders are a natural thing for this car and is nothing to worry about.I personally love the car much and intend to keep it for a couple of years.\n",

            "We own 2 honda civics right now .. 2010 and 2013 models. But due to change of taste i bought myself 2013 Altis 1.6 auto back in 2013 and this thing blew me away. Well interior is not quite impressive though but the drive and pick of this car is mind blowing. It is a terrific performer when it comes to speed and comfort .I can easily and openly say that I can beat any honda civic upto 2013 models (reborn) anytime and anywhere. Honda on the other hand is very heavy which creates lag in pick . As we can easily see the torque of civic reborn 1.8 is 144 and that of altis 1.6 is 154 .... Though altis lags in horsepower.  Altis  1.6 drive is more solid and fun to drive. When i push throttle to its limit.... I love the interior and exterior of civic no doubt but not performance .... Speed is subjective but honda on the other hand is very expensive to maintain and is not very reliable like corolla. Sorry for honda lovers (including myself).\n",

The government have no such a filtering department that regulate the local companies and provide them a quality standard, they have no such policy for the local companies to regulate them in a proper way...even some cars have not a fair braking system,, the government must recheck their policies.\n",

            "Interior quality is good and overall designing is perfect. Cup holders are infront of gear, unlike Corolla in which they are at the side which makes then impractical. With navigation installed, it seems very attractive. I like fiber cushioning of seats more than its leader seats. Seat foam is hard and needs improvement. However, one can soften it by adding foam  layer. Fuel economy is very good considering its pure 1300cc car. Local = 13-15km/l. Motorway = 15-17km/l without AC. No matter how rash one drives, City always gives good mileage. Its consumption is best at 3200 RPM with light foot (little release). Excellent car handling and driving pleasure. If Corolla gives driving comfort then City is leader in driving pleasure. Car is very responsive and turning radius is very good. Easily park in tight spaces. Best car for rash driving. Recommendations:Install 195/65/R15 imported soft tires. Secondhand tires works great. I promise you will not regret it .\n",

I want to warn  every one out there that no body should buy new launched cars of Pak Suzuki caz they dont care for there customers of new cars. Furthermore the Fuel Pump of my Wagon R is making abnormal noise. A team of Multan Fort Motors and a team of Pak Suzuki Karachi has inspected my car thrice and admitted that the voice is high and abnormal and can be dangerous and fuel pump need to be replaced but now 6 months has passed and today Pak Suzuki told me that we wont replace it and drive the car with the noise.\n",

Today I got the chance to test drive my friend's new Toyota.  The car is responsive and pick peppy, may be slightly better than City but its interior is downright disappointing.  The door panel fabric is very cheap material.  Even a locally assembled Suzuki has a better dashboard.  Everything in there smacks of callousness of the local manufacturers.  The stereo has no camera input either.  City on the other hand has a great interior, its seats are rugged and give you an assuring feeling.  I did not think that Toyota suspension was drastically different.  With good tires City drive can be equally comfortable.  Honda City is a brilliant car that gives good value for money.  I would rate it better any day.\n",

Though its routine maintenance components are a bit expense like its air filter which cost around 1500 Rs. I like its exterior as I always say the looks are always upto individuals. I dont like its interior as it is all black and remain dusty / dirty all the time. Fuel economy is superb. it cant get any better unless u move to hybrid or any other advanced technology. Although at times I felt it is a bit under power but with now 1.5 liter this issue must have been resolved. Final Words: Excellent Car in this price. Go for it...\n",

Its acceleration / pick is good as it has got a relatively big engine compared to cars of its size, but the chronic issues with Suzuki remains the same. The seat are not that comfortable, Braking system is not reliable. The fuel consumption is on a higher side compared to Honda city or xli in cities & on long routes. Interior is not bad. exterior shape is sleek and stylish but it depends upon the individual to like it or not.No words about maintenance as I never came across one. Final words: If you are spending like 1.4 million and u can manage a few more hundred thousands, go for honda or toyota. But as a second car its not that bad an option.\n",

Same is the case with back seats 2 inch shorter than corolla. Leg space is sufficient, same as Corolla.Trunk is almost same but narrow mouth opening so very large bag cannot enter into it unless we tilt it or put it side ways. Initially mileage was 12.5 km/l locally, 13.5km/l on motorway, and 14.5km/l on GT road. Now after 18,000 kms its mileage is surprisingly rises to 15.8km/l locally, 16.7km/l on motorway and 18.5km/l on GT road. This car gives high mileage on high RPM. Best mileage is at 3200 rpm. Try to drive it in 4th gear all the time.Old shape with plastic grill and simple back lights looks decent. New shape (facelift) looks cheap with metal grill and too many back lights.  Facelift also looks smaller than old shape. But facelift offers other goodies too. So its upto you.\n",

As I m not much concerned with the looks of the car rather i prefer better fuel economy with due comfort..It easily gives one with around 17 kmpl within city (i have not driven this on long routes), means with even light foot one can achieve more, quite cabin (no external noises when driving on busy routes) Apart from the better fuel economy this car gives clearer vision via rear & front wind screens due to its height. It is a very good addition in the  PS product offering and unlike crap cultus which is being developed with low quality materials.Wagon r offers good space for driver even a tall height-ed guy can easily fit in, passengers also enjoys this spacious vehicle along with the driver.

It took a lakh to fix the car, which was cheap, and car looked exactly like it was new. It was after the accident that I noticed that the fuel consumption was much much better. I think the work on the CVT transmission may have made the fuel consumption better, and  provided a much speed and control of the car.Even before the accident the car was giving a soundless drive with good suspension. I would recommend this car to bachelors, and those who want a 1 up of Cultus, otherwise spend a little more and get a xli if you can afford it.\n",

            "Perfect size to drive in urban areas. Best car handling experience ever. Unbelievable driving comfort and pleasure. Body is solid. Acceleration is perfect. 1300cc for Lahore and 1500cc for hilly areas. 2013 and onward Honda City has high suspension and seats like Corolla and drive of Honda Civic. Suspension of both old shape Corolla and City is same. Corolla seats are soft because of this jerks do not transfer into body. Both companies use same type of suspensions. Honda City saves you minimum 2 lakh from XLI and 3 lakh from GLI. I would suggest to save this money and use it for refueling your new Honda City for next two years. This makes the equation: Toyota Corolla = [ Honda City + 2 years of free fuel ]So the mileage of Honda City becomes unbeatable with any other car in this category including Toyota Prius, which cost 10 lakh more. Which means: Toyota Prius = [ Honda City + 10 years of free fuel ]. Honda City is for educated class and Corolla is for uneducated class.\n",

The leather seats are poorly made, hard and tiring on long journeys. Getting into the front passenger side is an art - there is an ugly hump under the front seats which makes entry risky. If you happen to step on the hump, you will most probably slip and fall on your back. Glove box is so small and has a bulge of the lock inside along with 3 communication cables making it practically useless. The suspension is hard and very unpleasant on rough roads. There is no value for money in the 1.5 and the \"Aspire\" - better to buy the \"Un-Aspired\" 1.3. The car struggles on the Kalar Kahar slopes of the motorway.

            "Exterior: the exterior of the car is much better then the previous model. At least there is something new about the exterior. The car is more aero dynamic and does not give a plain look like new Honda Civic. I have seen so many talking about new civic and about its exterior. Just be honest and comment when you compare the exterior of reborn with this new model civic it's obvious that reborn's exterior is far better than new civic. Further have a look at new Toyota Camry's model 2011 from the backside and you will know what I am talking about. Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): interior wise yes the new civic is better than toyota and from its counterpart reborn but again interior choice is always subjective. For me the drive of new toyota is more solid than civic as I have both. Climate control is of no use as we have to set it manually quiet often. Fuel Economy:the new Toyota whether Gli or altis has better fuel economyRide Quality & Hand: goodcool car\n",

On top of that the price is much more reasonable with respect to the available options. Driving experience is also very good in terms of stearability and acceleration. Interior finish is top notch and exterior too though not very sporty but very elegant. I am also impressed by the quality of after sales service provided by the Audi dealership.\n",

It is probably one of the best productions of Suzuki uptil now.Yes it does lack in a few things but if you can keep this car with care, its probably the best.I have owned this car for a whole year and only once had to replace its brakes but uptil now it is running completely on stock installations.The engine is quite powerful and quite noisy as well. But it gives excellent mileage. Probably the most fuel economic 1000cc car in Pakistan. Easily gives 17-18kms per litre within city with AC. Long route it gives 20kms/l.The interior is admittedly of cheap material. after some wear and tear of the vehicle, it starts squeaking from places where it is hard to find. a well maintained and cared for Cultus is excellent for driving in Pakistan :)\n",

            "I will offer few tech spec for the engines of both cars for the valued members of Pakwheels. The city is launched with L13A iVTEC engine which was developed for Honda Fit etc. A small tech review link is attached http://asia.vtec.net/Engines/LSERIESG2/.  The tech spec says it’s good for city commute due to its low RPM high torque, which also helps its fuel eco. Another edge is relatively better power to weight ratio. On the other hand Toyota corolla has 2 NZ-FE engine which was designed for 1.3 vitz etc and used by Toyota Pakistan in corolla since 2008 (Toyota E 140 wide body). The new corolla (E-170) has the same engine as the old one thus it will have somewhat the same power to weight ratio and fuel consumption. In short old wine in new bottle. Rest I leave it to your judgment.\n",

            "I went to Toyota Capital Motors today to have a look at Toyota GLi 2014 model before going for the purchase. I had some reservations regarding car's exterior specially the high ground clearance, aesthetically weak front bumper and awkward looking side curves/cuts but never really had a chance to look inside one. So, I went today to their showroom and oh God, believe me, the product is as horrific as you can possibly see. The quality of materials used on dashboard, doors, power windows buttons, pretty much everything perhaps is absolutely pathetic. Even my 2005 corolla has a better quality materials. I haven't driven the car, but I don't need to. Even Suzuki Swift has a better interior than this. i would give it just 2 out of 5. Totally pathetic product. Ironically, people don't have much choice here otherwise this product isn't worth around 2 million by any means. I believe, Honda City is a better alternative, if one can live with its barely acceptable suspension.\n",

One can observe the demands of the sellers of 1.5 apire before and after the introduction of this package. Minds of 90% Pakistani buyers (middle class) revolve around 1300cc car whether its Corolla, Nissan, Mitsubishi or Honda. If all the facilities once given in Aspire 1.5 are offered in 1.3 version, very few (upper class buyers) would go for power, rest will opt for economy and resale. So, Bad move in the eyes of 1.5 aspire owners but good move for Honda to earn profit. Let me assure you Mr CEO of Honda, you have lost a big %age potential buyers of your new city next year. Corolla is surely the market winner. I own aspire 1.5 (Dil Jala Diya Honda Ne)\n",

The car also hasn't been paid much attention in terms of alignment and quality as it's trunk is not properly aligned and some exterior parts move and rattle when the car is being driven on rough roads.Now lets talk about the interior, the interior is nice but not very comfortable, it's only good to look at. The new Corolla also lacks very basic features such as Climate Control.The car's performance is some what good, it's not because of the engine but because of the CVT transmission. The car's pick is very nice but it's braking doesn't seem to be very good, as takes quite some time to come to a stop when driving at speeds of about 80km/h.The value for money of this car is literally zero since the company provides only one airbag and that too only in Altis MT and better models.\n",

            "Fuel economy: As you can expect from a CVT-i (continuous variable transmission) is just made for economy. But toyota has tried more to make it a fuel efficient car. When car reaches at 5000 rpm the green light on speedometer disappears. So on harder acceleration green eco mode disappears. The main point is car is not efficient. Its your driving style that makes a car fuel efficientRide quality and handling: I am not a very big fan of electronic steering wheel. Ride quality is good car is silent. Steering wheel is a bit small. Man with big hands will be very annoyed to keep his hand on wheel. This is paddle shifters which make this car sporty to drive. A 138 bhp 1.8 L ENGINE delivers good accelerationOverall this 11th generation is a winner in comparison with \"9th generation of HONDA CIVIC\"\n",

According to height they should be a little thick.Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): I think the concept of simple straight dashboard is good because it looks fantastic on Rolls Royce phantom. But the clock in the centre is just look cheep. They could have make it a better clock. They have tried to copy the phantom on this.      I like the concept of android functions and system in the car. The sound system is good. Seats stiching is good. They are quite comfortable. But the absence of few functions like the climate control, led lights etc which are available in the corolla models in the middle east. The folding and reckline of seats is a good function for both comfort and to keep long goods.\n",

The width of the back seat is 1 inch lesses than Cultus. Tiredness after short drive. Secondly Tyre size is very small. Its of mehran size. Road grip is very less. Plus points.

I was just shocked to see what they are selling for Pakistanis. Do they think we are useless people? Our life costs nothing? In Pakistan assembled Wagon R there in NO Air Bag, Anti-Lock Breaking, Only front windows are powered, No retractable mirrors even the seats are uncomfortable.Still the price is almost 1 Lac high.I don't know why people are still purchasing this bull Shit.

            "the exterior is nice and rims are good.the thing that really fascinated me was its six speed manual transmission.i used to take it to my university and ussually i drove it with my friends. it is very comfortable and speedy car.it took it to 212 on motorway and believe it that it was as stable as it would be when running on 60 but on the other hand it skids very easily  and brakes are not good. my brother owns a swift and recently he bought a set of dunlop sliding tyres ussually called drifting tyres.the road grip of corrolla is so bad that there is no difference between his swift and my corolla. Safety wise this car is very insecure.even it is a 1.6. Its acceleration from 0 to 160 is like the honda city.whereas family wise this car is good and comfortable.i strongly recommend you to buy a honda civic reborn than a corolla 1.6.for family it is good but for drivers of my dna should go for a honda civic than this.\n",

            "All the features are good but the Old design Alloy Rims are not worthy with this model. It looks like Indus Motors have forgotten to change the design of Alloy Rims or they were in very hurry to just launch the car. But comparatively the launching is almost too late in Pakistan.\n",

            "Exterior: Nice design and stylingInterior: Lots of biggies including indash navigation which is surprisingly good enough sound and feature wise. Just the maps need to be updated on more frequent basis.Quality and comfort of Leather seats is not bad at all. Infact seat is more comfortable than its competitors. It also comes with keyless entry and great styling of the dashboardRide Quality & Handling:Bumpy Ride as compared to its competitors. Even a small piece of stone would be enough to feel inside the cabin. High RPMs at after 80KMPHIt has excellent handling on all conditions. I haven't found it in any lesser control on Motorway as others claim. Perfect Throttle Response. You can actually kick some butt of 1.8 Sedans (Auto Transmission)Fuel ConsumptionNot bad for a 1.5L engine with so much power. I have managed to keep it around 13KMPL with normal driving in the city. My habits include driving fast usually but change the gears fairly within advise range\n",

            "I got my Corolla Grande Automatic 1.8 with paddle shift. The color is Gun Metallic. The car look extremely bold and big from front but smaller from back. The dual halogen headlights and chrome plated grill is the main feature. Although this model lacks daylight neon/hid light as offered by overseas model. But you can order to Indus for daylight hid light which will fit on top of fog light. Also you can order head on display which is first for any car in Pakistan. The trunk is spacious. The rims are old as that of the old Altis offered in 2008/09. The car from inside is with leather, Andriod based tablet with built in Navi, SD card, USB card plus two cables to join with any devices you have. Need to explore with the book as it takes time to learn. The CVT offered is fabulous. The engine is so quite and the shifting is seamless. the car has very good low rpm high torque with 141 horsepower this car moves quietly like hybrid. The blue dial and the instrument panel looks like Merc c\n",

            "Problem 1. If you install CNG in 1.0L it will damage Transmission system. which costs about thousands for replacement.Solution, Install 1.3 assembly, B5 Computer and engine foundation to enjoy CNG. (Costs about 40-45 Thousand Rupees)Note: Toyota vitz 1.0 L,1.3L and Belta 1.0 L,1.3 L all have the same Transmission system. therefore no need to change transmission. You can also install Belta 1.3L engine.Problem 2. Most of new cars have electric AC compressors. Similar is the case with Toyota Vitz, These compressor are not long lasting.Solution; Compressor can be replaced with a magnetic compressor but you will need to do a slight amendment in AC Piping System. it costs about 15 thousand rupees.Road Clarence. Road Clearance is very poor. Vitz is not an ideal car for countrysid. Solution; Road Clearance can be increased by installing spacers or bigger springs in Shock Absorbent.I get an average of 220km with ac on 55 cylinder after installing 1.3L Belta Assembly\n",

The driving posture is unique in a good way after driving Civic when I set I feel like driving an SUV and its a good feeling but seats are flat I feel like without proper seat belts I would fall off of them.In short after we drive Civic, Corolla and Daewoo all nice saloons with nice road grip and interior when we drive this we dont feel bad or anything like you do when you drive Alto or Cultus and Mehran instead this gives you a nice feel.\n",

Almost 1000 Km's ,  Fuel consumption is 17 with AC with RPM = 3 , 90/95 KM/ Hour , If you would go above 100 , it would give around 14-15 . Comfort is excellent, Silent cabin , rear seat passengers were even feeling comfortable while comparing it with cultus , etc. Road grip was good with Dunlop 175/70/13 tires and have enjoyed its engine's quick pickup in 2nd and 3rd gear . AC was chilled , brakes are good but ABS could have been a better option for such car . Over all, very good experience, however within city I am getting 12 Avg with AC . As per suzuki, the average would improve after 5000 KM's service .\n",

But this is not as good as it is being appreciated.No doubt, exterior shape is awsome, but inside, rear seats are space less actually. Suzuki actually placed LIANA's engine in it, 1328 cc. That falls in the category of 1300 to 1500 cc, so registration of a car without trunk, is as much more than Corrolla XLI or Honda City.So do u think a car made by Suzuki having engine 1328 cc will consume less fuel than 1300 cc cars?Bad idea....\n",

I have changed its tire to Dunlop SP Sport Lm703 (175/70/r13), after this ride is more comfortable and very stable, it still give me 14.5 km/l within city traffic mostly jam packed with 70% ac and car still to have it first 1000 km service, so it will surely improve.Its stand out features are AC(awesome performance), Audio player, interior capacity and seating position, noise less cabin, smooth acceleration, power steering, goods brakes.Some negatives are 1) Take a little load on AC as compared when ac is off (I think engine is new, it will be better after first service).2) You feel wind pressure on cabin if its heavy like near sea and sometime we have very windy weather in karachi. 3) It would be great if it has ABS, power side mirrors and auto back door window.\n",

With the right curves,  225 R18 spec tyres and frameless windows, Audi has taken the pain to make it just right to be called a speedster.  Inside, what Audi is selling in Pakistan is only top of the line.  Thats what I like about them that they have put in at least Rs. 2,000,000 worth of extras which make the car luxurious.   The one I have has leather seats, heated side mirrors, cruise, triptronic, paddle shifts, rain sensitive wipers, adaptive headlights, parktronic, keyless entry and start and many other great features.The transmission is something I have not seen before.   It just does not change gears in normal mode.  And then you put it in Sport mode and it starts shifting gears at high RPMs.  Its noiseless and grips the road like a beast.Hands down a great buy!\n",

I'm hopeful that it will improve after the oil change,,,,with fully synthetic oil from Honda,,hopefully it should touch 20-21 km/l mark with AC on and 23-24 km/l w/o AC. OVERALL,,,excellent purchase. Great pick, great comfort, great value for money and the Best thing,,Great Leg Space for the Rear Seats. And last of all,,,I'm getting my car filled after Fajar,,,so no problems with the gases,,,, Enjoy,,if you have ASPIRE,,,\n",

Brakes worked so good, pick is so nice.I was worried after reading the feedback, while I bought this car. After having personal long drive. I am so much comfortable with its performance. I was a user of Cultus and must say that if someone is looking for good exterior looks than must go for Cultus but if you want really a new change within the same pricing, than WagonR is 100 times a good change Suzuki have made.\n",

Why would I even have a test drive or check it's comfort or fuel economy when it looks worse than Adam Revo. They have stripped off some necessary car beauty elements such as good front grill, air pressers, alloy rims, under-engine protective shields and the list goes on. They went too far with the practicality and now it looks more like a donkey cart than a car worth 11 Lakh. Gone are the days when people didn't have other options and they had to buy Mehran, Cultus or Alto. Now they are aware of the features, the cars have these days (Thanks to JDM cars).

            "Dear Friends,Most of the reviews seems like coming from Wagon R guys i mean Pak. Suzuki, I checked the car a couple of weeks back and test drive it as well, I was disappointed to saw the interior and exterior from style to strength,No safety parameters are taken in considerationThe drive though was not that good, pick is fine, cant comment regarding fuel economyI will recommend the VXL version, if someone deciding to go for WagonR, but bringing a VXL on the road costs more then 1.2 M, as the person has to pay (on top of 1089000) for freight, registration and 145/80/R13 tyres must need to be replaced with a wider and good quality tyres.Best Regards,\n",

            "Suzuki, though is a market leader in Pakistan but has never impressed me due to the poor quality control . After the launch of Wagon R  the company has really changed my opinion, a car which looks small from out side but  is very specious once you enters the cabin.Its height gives you an edge of  commanding view and control once you are on driving seat, The suspension is awesome with an excellent engine pickup,the added features like power window and key less entry  further adds to its comfort.  the car is also economical  on fuel.  over all much  better then cults and can be easily compared with Swift in its class.The AC  also powerful. Draw backs........??? they should have also given power windows for rear doors, and should have ABS brakes, The car is going to capture the market soon.over all a good addition to the deprived market of the country.\n",

            "Exterior: ok in comparision to older versions of city. Paint quality is average.Interior (Features, Space & Comfort):Ac good. Music system good. Rear space not as spacious as 2008 model. Euro star tires are like metal rails and spoils the mood to drive. Seats are not comfortable and seem like borrowed from corrolla. Trunk space is huge. Engine under the hood is well placed and service can be easily carried out.Fuel Economy:Prosmatic fuel efficiency is bad. Overtaking on a single road can be a real nerve testing exercise and you really have to push the car to move. Motorway mileage is around 15km.Ride Quality & Handling:Ride quality is like suzuki swift I.e. very stiff. Steering handling is good and brakes are average. Overall handling is above average.Final Words:There is no value for money. 1.7 mill for a 1.3L car is too much. For similar price one can buy corolla axio 1.5L. I m regretting this purchase. Think before you invest.\n",

            "If I compare this car with other 1300cc cars it has better performance than those it can easily take over gli xli city and even an altis or a civic cannot catch it till 140. But its not only about performance it does not have that much comfortable seats like corolla gli or city and even vitz the interior is also not that much attractive its just simple and I found vitz interior better than swifts but swift has much more space than vitz or cultus. We cannot compare cultus with swift cultus is too far behind. The interior quality is fine. If we look at exterior it is good. At last I will say that is car cannot be used for a family if you want to buy a 1300cc car best option is city or corolla. But if you want as a personal car just go for swift. If you are a guy aged 20-35 you will love this car because mostly guys only see performance of a car not interior or comfort. Oh yes fuel economy is also better than city or gli.\n",

I know few friends will disagree with me on this but let me clear you one thing..YOUR DRIVING STYLE DERIVES THE FUEL ECONOMY..If you drive it like a GOOD DRIVER it will give you good efficiency BUT if you are a newly converted driver from RICKSHAW driving to car driving you will get only 13-14! That's not the car fault, its YOUR fault.Ride Quality: ExcellentHandling: ExcellentFinal Words: If your budget is 6-7 lac you should only buy this car. Very easy to maintain.

            "After driving and owning almost all the versions of hatchback suzuki cars being in use in Pakistan, I was inclined to buy the city IVtec this time. Got the opportunity to drive this car on it's launching which was a pleasant surprise. The car looks small but  very spacious  from inside while sitting at the driving seat you feel to be in a commanding position because of it's height. The A.C and brakes are effective . The acceleration is also reasonably good. The 2 tone dashboard looks beautiful. We should not compare it with the imported cars for abs brakes and air bags as they don't have the company backup or release value.\n",

Although its not a bad looking car. You can't get a car with all these features in such a low price tag. Excellent package. But my suggestion to go for VXL which costs just 40k more and you don't need to spend much on accessories. It will be peace of mind.\n",

Navigation works perfect and is very helpful during driving. I previously owned City 2010 model and Honda improved this model in many ways.Fuel Economy is not bad. I have drove 2000 km and found it up to 15 on highways and 12.5 km/l in city.Shocks are bit harder if I compare it with Corolla A/T 1.6. Earlier I was going for Corolla 1.6 A/T but due to many missing features I left it since in aspire you get all in the price (Prosmatec transmission, Navigation, Alloy Rims, Leather covers, etc) . Second reason as the shape is going to change in Corolla very soon.Car is over priced like Corolla models. Plastic dashboard, hard suspension, missing fog lights are only disadvantage I see in this car.Overall a very good family car for everywhere drive. Highly recommended if anyone really want a comfortable drive.\n",

I observed were; even in the VXL variant, the back doors do not have Power windows and even this variant does not have alloy rims even after paying 1,089,000 rupees for the VXL model. Pak Suzuki could have provided a proper LCD with a rear view camera which is almost an essential item nowadays. If you compare your VXL version with Maruti Suzuki Wagon R, then a hell of differences of features and its price(In Pak Rupee  almost 7.25 Lakh), compare it with Pak Suzuki Wagon R:http://www.carwale.com/marutisuzuki-cars/wagonr10/vxiabsairbag-features-2786.html\n",

            "Over Swift 1.3 is a beautiful design and performs a lot better than so called other big names like Xli. We were apprehensive to buy automatic version but now after a month of use and over 1000 KM milage we are glad that we bought the automatic version.The exterior is very elegant and has sporty look. We have the white color which I think looks pretty (personal view on color). The interior is fine although not luxurious. The car comes with immobiliser and has factory fitted Bridgestone tyres and Alloy Rims save you at least 40 to 50K when you buy City or Xli. The Alpine stereo system is nice and is adequate for daily use. The performance of Swift is excellent, great pickup, and stability even a high speeds. The breaks are super responsive and have ABS which Xli lacks. I'm getting 14kmpl easily with RPMs around 2000 to 2200. If you drive it steady and not like u are driving on a race track, you can get great performance. ONE HAPPY DRIVER HERE!\n",

I think you got my point, guys its a service car not a luxury saloon which we would buy in 0.7 million.its cheap on fuel.cheap on parts.cheap on services.cheap on repairs.best resale of all times.its not for a pleasure drive or long distances. but still we can use it for long distance drive as it has best fuel economy.now for those who are really looking for the luxury then, above all forget the resale and fuel economy, cheap parts, cheap repairs, just go for the Japanese car 660cc, you would find everything in it, but still those cars wont beat the Mehran.\n",

I inspected the car thoroughly. Initially I was of the opinion that it was good value for money. But close inspection showed otherwise. I think a fair price for the car considering the quality of the material used in the car is around 15 Lakh at the most. The quality of the rear seats is definitely not one that you would like on a long ride, which is what these cars are intended for. The seats are basically stiff and of very poor quality. However, the good thing is that they are held by two nuts only and thus can be changed. The doors close a bit too loud and the side view mirrors are shaky - something reported by a South African user as well. The gear box is basically cheap as well. On the positive side, the headlights and the LED side indicators are cool. Also it comes with dual airbags, ABS and a powerful AC.\n",

            "Suzuki Swift is Better on value than corolla, i bought this car in October, new it was, and still is 450 Km on ODO and guess what it gives a \" 14.65 kmpl \" in 2-3k rpm. ac is excellent, just in 5 minutes i satrt shivering with a 36 deg on temp i found it hard to keep my hands on steering which was directly in line with ac ventthis cars features are better than corolla well ofcourse drive is not that better than corolla, but the actual value one get from it is!. final cost of it was 14 lac, i also considered corolla but i'm more into actual value of product rather than some resale value of a crappy \"KHATTOLA\"the plastic quality is the same as that of a corolla, comes with ABS EBD, central locking power windows alpine sound system alloyrims color door handles etc, hence everything what a near cost corolla lacks, remember that when i bought it this car cost me 14 lac where as a equivalent corolla would have cost me 19 lac. which is just being insane for a useless boot.\n",

Car dealers in Pakistan import it in a bad condition ( almost Grade 1 cars) then send it to workshops where its denting , repainting and other cosmetics work is done. It is almost remodelled . Its odometer is altered . And when it is brought to the showroom , it looks like new. Now one can think what it was before the cosmetics work. Despite all this , its comfort , fuel economy and luxury is far superior to other locally made cars. It is not a bad car to buy.\n",

            "The Sirius is based on the design of the previous Toyota Avanza, which is arguably more attractive than its successor. There is only one seven-seater in the range, and it must be said that its generous level of equipment comes as a big surprise. It comes with alloy wheels (including the spare wheel), remote central locking, ABS with electronic brake distribution, dual airbags, electric windows all round and LED indicators in the electrically-adjustable door mirrors as standard equipment. A rear window wiper is conspicuous by its absence, which is a shock considering that the Sirius is otherwise very well-equipped. There is a demister on the rear window, which helps a bit, but a wiper is essential in heavy rain. There is an MP3-compatible radio with a USB port, but because there is no CD player, you have to load your music onto a flash drive. This does not suit everybody, and a CD player is still an essential feature of any sound system in my honest opinion. There are head rest\n",

And my favorite activity (like many of Pakwheelers) was to insult Mehran in every other post :) But when I entered professional life, I realized I can't spend my weekends in workshops just to get my vehicle running during weekdays. That was the time I needed some new vehicle.My maximum budget was 900 K and the only brand new car under this budget was Suzuki Mehran. Other options were to add some money and buy Cultus or go for imports (Mira, Alto or Passo). My considerations were running costs, ease of maintenance and resale.Analyzing these factor the optimum choice came out to be Suzuki Mehran. I currently own both the VX and VXR versions.

When you'll try to buy a City people are going to say \"The spare parts are expensive\". Let me tell you, they are not! The better item, the higher the cost. They are a bit expensive but they are affordable. Or better yet, just get your car insured. Secondly, people are going to claim that Honda City has a low resale value. I'll agree but then again, the car has been underestimated. Anyone with a good brain would prefer Honda City over any other car that you'd get for the same amount.Thank you Honda!\n",

Spacious, good quality plastics used and comfortable seats. Very beautiful silver built-in music system's dashboard.Fuel Economy: This is probably the ONLY con of this car. Fuel-wise it's not as efficient as a city or vitz. However, this also depends on the driving style.Ride Quality & Handling: Amazing road grip. Superb acceleration. Really feels like the seat slipping from under you. No car can catch up to it. Not sure about the new Aspire 1.5 - but all the 1.3 cars were never up to the challenge of speed posed by this little beast.Final Words: This is one of the best cars to be rolled out of the PS assembly factory yet. The build quality is as good as a Civic (if not better). I can say that because I also own a Civic 2013.I have driven this Swift very rashly as well, taking it to far fledged areas of Punjab - but it's smoothness in the drive was never compromised. My advice to people who are considering to buy a 1300CC car - go for a Swift - an excellent ride for urban to sub-urban dwellers. Even though I am myself a Honda fan, I would recommend this Swift over a City (unless you want to go an extra mile and get the Aspire 1.5 which is a total waste of money because a few more bucks will get you an Altis - a far better car than Aspire). City's suspension is the worst ever - Swift is a very good car and can fit in many different roles - a first car for a young professional, a first car for a young couple or a small family, a second car for a upper-middle class family, etc\n",

            "I bought Swift DLX manual back in July 2011. Within the first month of its use, I experienced a tuk sound in low speeds and quick pick up. It was very annoying for me so i reported the same to My dealer (Suzuki Taxila Motors) from where I initially bought the car. I was told that it's the axle's fault. They reported the matter to the company. An authorized person (Mr. Ibrar)of Pak Suzuki for this region checked my car and said that its because of a pin in the gear box and that needs to be changed. so they lowered the gear box and changed that pin. the sound went off but only for a week. it came back and is there ever since.... Finally I was told try to live with it 'coz even the Japanese can't do anything about that......It really frustrates me!!! So did anyone experience the same sound?? and found any cure for that??? plz respond!Apart from that the car is Ok as far as its style and comfort is concerned. Fuel consumption is not that gud. Would give around 11 kmpl in local with AC and 14-15 KMPL on the highway. without AC the local average goes to around 12-13 kmpl and on highways from 15-16 kmpl.\n",

            "Posted by Haris Khan on Mar 12, 2013\n",
            "Exterior: Many people disagree but Honda City offers a strong built car and much better than Toyota Corolla GLI. Toyota has been bulking up the new Corollas and this is one of the reasons it gets scratches and dents the most in our crowded traffic of Pakistan. The shape is more focused towards young guys with an aggressive look. Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Honda City offers a beastly interior. The elegant black interior and completely different shapes provides a very sleek and appealing interior. It's indeed not as much spacious as Corolla but at least it's new and awesome! While on the other hand, most of the Pakistan manufactured cars are offering the same interior since ages. Thank God Honda has thought of something new. The car is comfortable enough but not the best. Seriously, neglect this factor as there is much more and if you care so much about the comfort then get a soft pair of tiers and you can have pretty good comfort. The car has enough room to relax and stretch for five persons and put your goodies in the huge trunk. The most coolest feature in terms of capacity is they are now offering very good amount of space below the rare seats where you can put your small items i.e Laptops.Fuel Economy: The best in Pakistan. No other Pakistan manufactured car could be a comparison. The reason is simple that Honda has not bulked up the car with unnecessary amount of weight. The car runs perfectly fine on Petrol and on CNG as well but make sure to get it done from someone good who knows what he is doing.Ride Quality & Handling: Again, the best among the Pakistan manufactured cars. The engine is soundless, the handling is just perfect! The car is fully under your control at maximum speed and the ABS is your best friend. Final Words: Let me explain. When you'll try to buy a City people are going to say \"The spare parts are expensive\". Let me tell you, they are not! The better item, the higher the cost. They are a bit expensive but they are affordable. Or better yet, just get your car insured.Secondly, people are going to claim that Honda City has a low resale value. I'll agree but then again, the car has been underestimated. Anyone with a good brain would prefer Honda City over any other car that you'd get for the same amount.Thank you Honda!\n",

The acceleration and drive is much much smoother than any car driven before and the navigation system leather seats and all other features make it a good value for money. Although the fuel economy is not so good as compared to my previous corolla which did almost 15km/l. The civic hardly gives an economy upto 10km/l.. But with this power and smooth drive i must say thumbs up to honda for coming up with such a car...\n",

            "Posted by Usama Ahmed on Mar 01, 2013\n",
            "Exterior: Its exterior is just superb. The looks of swift is damn hot from every angle. Motto of swift lived up to my expectations. \"Feel Young Drive Young\".The only bad thing about it is low quality doors. They must have used good quality doors.Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Its interior is also quite attractive with very nice 2din CD Player with 4 awesome speakers which have very good bass and sound quality.The things which i wanted more are media buttons on steering, it would be too good to have. And less sound in cabin, but it is SUZUKI so we must know about it when we make our mind to bought it. Front seats are little hard but its ok, Rear seats are very soft and it is quite comfortable at back to sit.Fuel Economy: Fuel economy is good, its definitely not what people said. Within city with little bit ac it is giving me average between 11-15km/ltr, depending about driving style. But recommend people to change gear in btw 2-3K rpm. Ride Quality & Handling: Swift has little hard suspension so the ride drives kind of sporty with excellent pickup and very good at cornering. But is quite rough on bad or bumpy roads due to hard suspension but it is not the cars fault, it thats the road are quite bad here.Final Words: If anyone wants a brand new hatchback in the range of 1.3M then i will definitely recommend Suzuki Swift. Its the best bang for buck.\n",

            "Exterior: The overall look is greatInterior (Features, Space & Comfort): Has excellent set of features, lots of buttons, everything automatic. Pak Suzuki however (compared to the international version) has removed ABS, indicator lamps from the side mirrors, Outside Temperature reading and Estimated Mileage reading from the Pakistani version of Swift.Fuel Economy: 12 KMPLRide Quality & Handling: Ride quality is horrible on bumpy/damaged roads. Pak Suzuki is not fully doing there job when it comes to finishing. They probably don't even do a drive test before the car is made ready for delivery. You can spot a thousand problems in their brand new car, mostly mechanical issues. The inside of the doors are bare metal without any padding of  sound absorbing materials etc. So they vibrate when you crank the volume up on your sound system. Also on bumps the ride gets too noisy. On smooth roads however the cabin is pretty quiet. Suspension is hard, but that gives you the advantage of good braking and good handling.Final Words: It is for sure a lovable car. You can really feel the thrust with which the car moves when you push the accelerator all the way down. One reviewer mentioned that the car doesn't move above 120KMPH but this is because he couldn't really push the accelerator further down. I'm not sure whether this is a feature or not but accelerator pushes very easily until a point. Beyond that point you need to press it quite harder and that is the point when the car actually goes above 120KMPH. Build quality sucks big time, but the engine doesn't. I'm really enjoying my ride.\n",

            "Exterior: The styling is excellent and the car is very attractive. It's sleek and it's actually shaped like an arrow. Overall, the design and build is fantastic.Interior: The interior is brilliant, especially if you opt for beige cloth instead of black. The quality of the upholstery and all the materials, even if they are plastic, is very good. The stereo system is also a good one for this price range.Fuel Economy: Fuel economy is exceptional in this car, it achieves 11.4 km/l of mostly city driving with the A/C on all the time and being thrashed around. Because of the current CNG crisis, buying this will help preserve CNG reserves.Ride Quality: The ride quality is very good, and it's not as hard as many people say, but it is harder than a Corolla. That might be a good thing because this feels better over bumps than my old GLi, that was too jumpy.Performance & Handling: This being a Honda, lives up to expectations and the acceleration is amazing. Handling, too is brilliant, even at high speeds, like 130 km/h, it does not wave around or vibrate much. Acceleration is better than the Swift or GLi/XLi and it can easily take them in a drag race.Final Words: Honda has outdone themselves with this car and this is an excellent buy for anyone thinking about it. This is better than the GLi/XLi or the Swift/Liana, and I can vouch for that having owned all of them. I would recommend going for the auto as the manual is jerky, but you should test drive it as you may feel differently. Thank you.\n",

            "Dear readers,I did a lot of research to buy a new car in 1300 cc range. My choices wer Xli, City and Swift. After digging the threads and user opinions, I was totally confused in making a choice among these 3 options. Personally, I am a fan of Honda since I have been using Civic for the last 10 years and owned almost 4 different models of Civics. I was totally against buying Corolla as I am used to drive Honda. Later, I took test drives of both City and Corolla and decided to go for Corolla this time. Civic was out of my pocket. I am now very happy and satisfied with my selection.. This new Xli is beyond my expectation.I can safely say that Corolla has got some good driving pleasure with comfort, economy and great looks.I hope my post is going to help those people who are stuck in making decision to buy a new car. Go for Corolla, you will not regret. Good resale also :)Take care.\n",

I have taffeta white.Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): In comparison with Gli 2013, City Aspire has more features like Navigation, Rear Camera, 4 speakers, leather seats, etc. It's trunk is bigger than Corolla's trunk. Corolla has bigger cabin but city is more comfortable.Fuel Economy: No doubt City has better fuel economy currently it's giving me 12-13 km/l. As it's only 250km driven. New car eats more fuel , but with the time it's fuel economy will increase.Ride Quality & Handling: Ride quality is just acceptable. Handling is very good as it's suspension is very hard. Hard Suspension, i think it's a plus point for better handling but a negative point while driving on bumpy roads.Final Words: This is a complete family car, only for Urban Areas.\n",

            "I brought the car 3 years back. Its the fully loaded version at that time, power steering, power windows and alloy rims. So far after three years every electrical and mechanical equipment is working fine. This car has the best leg room space in its class no doubt. I have also driven the Honda city, the rare and front leg room of Cultus is amazingly equal to HOnda City and the ride is even much more comfortable than Honda City. Its unfortunate the Suzuki has stopped the VXL version of cultus (only to promote the Swift) but I wish that they re-launch its fully loaded version with Electrical Power Steering (EPS). My VXLi has hydraulic Power Steering. Overall its one of the most comfortable, reliable and fule economical car in town given me almost 22 kmpl on highway and 17 kmpl in city with AC on CNG. On petrol it gives almost 17 kmpl on highway and 15 kmpl in city with AC. I am very much satisfied with this car and am using it for the past three years without any problem. I got it zero meter and so far it has crossed 66000 kms.\n",

Next door in India same shit has been changed to modern look, quality is much better and available for 1/2 of the price compare to Pakistan.Every time government try to relax imports duty on cars. Pakistan car manufacture/ Assembelersstart shitting in their pants. They cry we will not be able to compete and go out of bussines. This is UNJUSTICE to Pakistani cars consumers. Bottom line is better to buy used JAPAN assembled imorted small cars. They are way better than SHITY MEHRAN. What a JOKE after 30 years of maunfactering same SHIT.

            "This car (Reborn) is a must buy if you have the required cash. It is an excellent choice and I don't regret it in any way :)Exterior: Really stylish. Opposed windscreen wipers add a premium look. Looks fantastic in Silver and White.Interior (Features, Space & Comfort): Generous amount of features. Air Conditioning fan speed control is excellent as you have a wide range of fan speeds rather than the traditional 4 speeds. Very spacious cabin with a nice set of seatings. Headrest is a bit annoying but can be removed. I found the boot/trunk space a bit limited.Fuel Economy: Fuel economy increases day-by-day. Highway economy is excellent from the start! I would recommend everyone to fuel up with 50% Hi-Octane and 50% Super (Regular) fuel, it increases the engine life and has various other positive factors.Ride Quality & Handling: The drive is unmatched. Handling depends on tyre quality. Speaking of which, I would recommend everyone to replace their tyres immediately after the car purchase as the stock tyres are extremely hard which give a very bumpy ride. Stick to stock tyre size or if you want a good look extend to a max of 205/50 R16. Yokohama Advan DB would be recommended.Final Words: A great family sedan for everyday driving and for long trips. Go for it! ;)\n",

            "Honda has been a trendsetter and especially in Pakistan people find it very hard to accept change. I don't want to sound bias just because I recently purchased one ;) but because the surprise that this car gave me in so many aspects. Firstly came the price tag which was a little pinchy however not very bad compared to other cars in the category for example the altis which is a 1.6. Secondly came the looks which people compared that to the city, but believe me once you notice the car for the second or third time it looks good and eventually grows over you. Thirdly the drive and performance was ecstatic although when I first heard about the Eco drive I thought that must have reduced the horses running in the engine but the Extra 10Hp from the reborn engine can quite be felt when you floor the pedal even the mighty swift can't pull away till 100 now, but that being said the car has been a pleasure to drive, it doesn't provoke you to speed rather tells you to enjoy a simple drive with your loved ones. I feel the main reason for the civic not really being hot news is a catchy name, so I decided to call it the \"Mutant\". If your car requirement is that of a luxurious, powerful yet economical as well as a hight tech and safe family sedan, then without a second thought GO FOR IT.\n",

Build quality is fine but not like VITZ.Problem: The body paint is of very bad quality and badly done, so silver and white color are preferable, in a zero meter car it is full of noises coming from interior and dashboard. Rear sears are not comfortable, low visibility and difficult to park in tight places.Plus Points: After 5000km 2nd inspection the car is superb , great fuel consumption on petrol and GAS, 15km - 16km on petrol in city without A/C, and 220km on Gas with 55L cylinder without A/c,Pick on gas is awesome even thought my car is automatic but there is no pickup issue.

            "suzuki has released a very nice machine for first time, that is swift. it has got style, engine is powerful, cabin is comfortable and quiet and a good AC, overall its a nice package. but compared to popular belief i want to clarify my brothers here that suzuki swift DX is not that awsome as it seems, against popular belief, it does not have keyless entry (after spending 12lac you dont even have this basic option), no ABS breaks, door knobs and side mirrors are black no matter what color your car is (imagine 12lac bucks spent and this!). no fog lights!!!, well alloy rims are not present but thats acceptable. as a whole running acceleration pick is equal in DX and DLX, but in gadgets DX is just shat.i suggest with this money either go for DLX (13lac after registeration, one thinks why not buy city :p) or buy imported vitz, with loads of options. thanks\n",

People say that there is no problem with the parts etc... Becasue new cars do not need parts... they will need maintainence after 3 years and than they will come to know... Only Vitz has been the best cars in imported ones. you'll not get the resale value of imported cars after 3 years. You can suffer alot to find a similar side mirror. or head light or brake light/bumpers etc. If you can bear costly maintainace you can go for Imported cars.beside it Mehran is the best choice to drive inside city. Very cheap maintainance. Very good Feul economy sepcially after new EFI engine. engine is better now. and the best thing ever you can sale it in one day. and you'll get good value.\n",

            "Well Corolla and City owners are just throwing bricks on each other. Both Corolla and Honda are good cars so please give honest reviews.I own both GLi 2012 and Honda City Prosmatic (October 2012 model). So heres my experience about HONDA CITY. Pros1 - Very stylish looks.2 - Fuel economy is excellent. My Prosmatic gives me 18 on Highways without AC provided I keep speed at 100 Km/Hr. Within city in lot of traffic its giving me 13-14 without AC. On the other hand Corolla Gli MANUAL due to its weight and bulk hardly gives me 12 within city and 14-15 on highways.  3 - Titanic interior now being offered is really stylish as compared to Corolla. 4 - Price is less as compared to Corolla. My prosmatic with company fitted Navigation/Multimedia cost me Rs 1,696,000 whereas Corolla Gli manual without any Multimedia/Navigation currently cost the same.5 - Honda City is really quite while driving there is no engine sound at all. Its also really streamlined for effecient Airflow reducing air drag and noise. Corolla's engine on the other hand is not so quite.Cons1 - Seats are Hard and are not at all comfortable as compared to Corolla.2 - Suspension is hard and seems much delicate than Corolla. Even in the first 1000 Kms I have realized that Honda City is not made for rough Roads. You have to take great care not to take it to bumpy roads. Corolla however, is made tough for any type of roads.3 - Although more fuel effecient, engine seems to have less power as compared to Corolla 1.3.4 - I have experienced minute knocking so I have to mix High octone as a remedy which solves the problem. Corolla's engine happily accepts any type of petrol without any knocking etc. Conclusion:If you travel alot on rough bumpy roads then Honda City is not the car for you. However, provided you stay on known/smooth/good routes than this car is probably the best possible option for you.\n",

Indus Motor should think over to make it cheaper that a number of people can surely own a Prado :) However , the build quality and assembly of this dream machine is quite better than that of Hilux,Vigo . Buying a Prado is a factor but affording it is surely another ! Price is too high that only an Elite class can manage to buy . On the contrary if one manages to get on lease .. it will not let him seat idle or tension free for over 10 upcoming years . Saying A crore is easy but earning is infact not . So is the point , A leased Prado costs around 20 Million (*3.0 and 4.0 Engines) . Will it be a wise decision to go for a Prado ?? Especially when you can own a much more worthfull thing in much less cost ! This is the only reason you will rarely see a new Prado on road , whereas Land Cruiser's VX , V8 etc are abundant on roads. All in All , if you can afford .. do not ask anyone for any feedback or suggestion . Go and Buy ! That's all !\n",

Dash board and trim is good but not stylish as in City. Plenty of space in front and back seats. in backside floor is more straight with slight curve so gives more space to rear passengers as compared to previous generation corolla.Huge trunk spaceMusic system is average but has 4 speakers and has USB support. Front speakers are mounted on door (6.5 inch) and rear speaker are in the back (6*9 sized). The quality of speakers is main cause of average sound from sound system and can be easily improved by changing speakers and adding an amplifier etc. After market DVD players with navigation system are easily available which blend with dashboard and connect pin to pin with no alterations. but they lack premium sound quality.CNG can be installed but no recommended by most people and gives very good milage on CNG but i have no personal experience.On petrol pickup is good but not better than similar 1300cc cars. Average milage in average driver is 12-14(in city) and 14-16 (highways) but light foot can increase it to 2-5km/l.Pick up and power wise this car is inferior in its league. On outside has good headlights with separate bulbs for low and high beams (great use at night). it has built in indicators in side mirrors which are body colored. tail lights are also good but not stylish. As compared to older model of corolla, it has a body which is large in width which creates mainly problems for average and even good drivers as it is subject to greater impacts and dents .\n",

Shape and interior styling is nice but poor quality really dampens the mood. Dashboard is all plastic. Door handles spray painted in silver. over lining pads on the pilar are uneven. The body seems weak and prone to rust going ahead. Honda are charging so much yet they have left areas which need to be addressed. There is no inner lining beneath the hood and boot cover. The leather option does not include a leather steering, ridiculous. If your height is around 6ft then make sure you sit in the front. Electrically adjustable seats and VSA would have been a good option especially in the top model which nears 2.5mn. Haven't driven one as yet so can't comment on comfort and performance but I assume that performance would be exciting. Also I hope the turning radius on this model is improved as reborn has a horrible turning radius.\n",

            "Posted by Umer on Oct 19, 2012\n",
            "I recently has bought new civic 2012 i-VTEC prosmatec. Overall I love the car and its driving experience. So far I have drove 1000km and on 1000Km its giving me 10.5 km/l average with my drive mostly in city area. Previously I own 2006 and 2010 Corolla GLI. As I compare my new civic with Toyota Corolla below are few differences1. Suspension of Civic is really hard as compare to the smooth suspension of Corolla. I really miss my corolla when driving on bumpy roads :). But when i compare its Handling its way too good then corolla. 2. civic has excellent acceleration and a very good auto gear shift. I have drive 1.8 and 1.6 altis but civic is faster than both and I have compare reborn 2006-2012, new civic has the same engine and transmission but better drive than its predecessors'. New civic is faster then the old one becoz of weight reduction. 3. New civic has many good features and a very decent and elegant interior, which give you complete feel of control over the car. steering controls, iMID display, height adjustable seats and a beautiful blue glow in dashboard lights. 4. The ECON botton is a good addition, but as far as its effect on fuel economy is concern its not very significant. Yes if you are a rash drive or like to push your car hard then ECON option will save some fuel for you as it limits your car performance and change your driving style. For me as I often drve with soft foot its effect on economy is almost nil and I really to like to drive with ECON on as its limits your gear shift and for downshift you have to push car hard and its response get too slow. new 1.6 dual vvti altis is way better in economy then new civic. 5. There is no engine noise in cabin and you really enjoys a peace in drive, but then when you push car its gives you a roaring sound and a great acceleration. Normally at 80km/hr speed RPM is stable at 1.5 and at 120km/hr its on 2.5. The fuel economy on highways is way better then in city and it can easily give to 15km/hr on highway. 6. front projected lights are a good addition from honda.7. and off-course immobilizer.  Overall its a very nice car. I love the shape and love its interior. Being a corolla fan for years, now I'm enjoying my Honda Civic. Yup friends honestly as compare to reborn, this car has a better drive better economy, improved handling with EPS and EBD. front drive side and passenger side airbags in i-vtec variant.\n",

            "When you spend 1.4 million of your hard earned money you look for comfort, style and fuel economy to some extent as well. For me the experience so far is satisfying if not so great. The over all looks are good, although interior is made up of cheap plastic and even after using it for 14000KM in last 1.5 year it has never gave me major rattling noises. Fuel economy is good but the drawbacks are poor acceleration and really bad suspension. Suspension issue can be resolved by putting a better quality tyers with a bit more profile but that will not totally solve the problem and after buying this car you have live with the fact that it is just like this\n",

Civic has suspension which cannot afford bumps and humps. Toyota can bear everything which comes in it's path. Also one can feel the bumps more in civic as compared with toyota. Yes when it comes to drive on moterway, civic takes the lead. Comfort is perfect, as good as civic, specially the cruise control let's your legs relax on motor way while you are driving 400km to ISL. Performance I will give it one less as when it comes to pick of the car, civic will give you instant boost when you floor the accelerator as compared to corolla which you might be a bit lazy.Value for Money for sure, within this price range the features offered are comparable with any other car in the market.Fuel Economy is far better than civic.\n",

Price is a bit higher but what else you expect in current scenarios. It has added features for example cruise control that doesn't even come with CL7 or CL9 no doubt Toyota started offering it way back. Then it has climate control which Toyota is still not offering. Plus new improved Honda multimedia display system which is far much better than the cheap china Reborn one. The ECON mode should make a difference i mean if Honda is claiming it, it should as compare to reborn which will give almost the same mileage/liter even if you drive it at super economy RPM.over it has other small luxury features like jackknife key, door lamps, aux, Intelligent multi info display, key less trunk opener etc. All these features are new and they do add value. Car lovers pay money for all these nitties-grittiest cause this make up to luxury that we all want in life.In the end design may not be appealing for few but as always people will start loving it in no time and reborn will grow old.\n",

Here in Pakistan we always complained that Price is too high, quality is average and lastly some features are lacking when compared to models launched internationally.While the outgoing 8th Gen civic was a market leader recently, the new civic wont be any different.Both exterior and interior styling is Top Class, i call it a Mini Accord, fit and finish is immaculate, and the Tech.innovative features are second to none.Price wise it is O.K 1.9-2.4million PKR, considering the Exchange Rate against US$ is Rs.95/-, which has direct impact as these cars come in CKD Kits. 4years ago when dollar was Rs.59 civic was @1.5million Rupees.In the End it is a Must buy for anyone.\n",

            "My first impression, \"Oh this is a slightly longer version of Honda City\" I really dont like the Exterior, but the Interior Rocks. Black Color which lacks a little shine though is awesome curved giving an amazing feel infront of you, the LCDs and the Meters are seriously outstanding the positioning of the meters do not get your eyes away from the Road.The new Aero Dynamic body Shape and with a lighter body having the same old 1.8L engine are the key ingredients for a far better fuel economy. Leg Room is nice, very comfortable seats good roof distance...iMID technology is something we all would love to have.All in all i would rate this car 8/10.\n",

            "City is more stylish than Corolla has cheap black interior, it now has got beige interior which is even better than Corolla's...City is really fun to drive, pick is great because when you are drving the VTEC kicks in and you enjoy it...Corolla has some major advantages over City that Its Much more comfortable than City because as we all know that City has unfortunately got a hard suspension so the ride is less comfortable which i simply can't understand the actual reason behind this which only Atlas Honda knows because it is such a nice car, Sleek and Stylish but the reality is that the drive of Corolla isn't comfortable only its seats are comfortable which means the ride is comfotable but CITY IS THE CAR WHICH HAS GOT comfortable drive but uncomfortable ride quality and City is not a good performer on bumpy roads such as in villages and it can also not sustain heavy drives while Corolla has all these benfits!!!Corolla has a bigger and solid body which is very durable for years while City is a bit sensitive in this caseNow coming to the other side City has good power to weight much better pick and a very smooth drive as the its engine horsepower and torque is more than Corollas!!!City has got very cool colours such as Alabaster Silver, Taffeta White, Polish Metal, Deep Lapis Blue Metallic, Crystal Black, Habanero Red amd and Bold Beige Metallic!!!and coming to the end i believe that the brakes of City are better than Corolla as they are ABS AND YOU KNOW Honda ABS is awesome!!!So the conclusion of my review is that Corolla is a car for old peoplewhile City is the choice for younsters!!!\n",

            "Posted by Haroon on Sep 05, 2012\n",
            "Toyota Camry is a well renowned brand all over the world due to its reasonable price and reliability stats. Then again in Pakistan; we are a little different then the rest:). Here  its among the best cars available from the Company. We get only 2.4 version with almost basic trim while in Australia and other countries it also comes in 3.0. This car has a descent history in Pakistan.Overall:This car overall has nice lines, comfortable interior, descent looks and its among the more reliable cars. It wont feel under powered if not powerful and does have good road grip and a feel for the driver. While one negative aspect is that it does not have that low center of visual gravity like other cars.Performance:It comes in 2.4L and wont feel under power in any regard. The maintenance is least although a little bit expensive. The car is responsive and feels great as a daily driver. The ride is comfortable and pleasant while at times braking on wet surfaces might get it a little off balance. The car has Electronic Power Steering (EPS), Anti-Lock Braking (ABS), Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD). While this particular trim does not have any Vehicle Assistance or Stability Controls.Interior:Interior is in beige and comfortable with 8-way supportive seat, electronic driver and passenger seat. Comes with sunroof, 6 in-dash cd/mp3 player with steering buttons. It has automatic climate control and the A/C is a class of its own and comes with ion filter, which wont stress engine even if driving uphill and does not either effect fuel economy. It has auto-headlamps and rain sensing wipers which are convenient features. The interior is nicely laid out with everything in total reach of the driver. Car comes with pinch-free Auto Glass side mirror and retractable and auto side mirror. The car has a built in security system with immobilizer and security alarm.Mileage:Local with A/C 9-9.5 km/LLocal without A/C 10 km/LHighways with A/C 12-12.5 km/LHighways without A/C 13km/LThe mileage is descent provided driving the car with slightly heavy foot.Pros:Descent engine with good mileage and power bandComfy and spacious interiorA daily driverGood sterio systemCons:Expensive partsWet braking is at times an issuePrice:The price of Camry in Pakistan started at around 23 Lacs which was just perfect but now it is almost touching 96 Lacs for the new model which has new shape and some new feature but that just does not compensate for 70lacs + of price hike.I might settle for Mercedes Benz C or E class, may be Toyota Mark X 3.0g and there are a lot of other options.\n",

            "Posted by Haroon on Sep 05, 2012\n",
            "Suzuki Alto (now discontinued) is a well reputed car in Pakistan even with its outdated engine and looks.This car comes with the same engine that was used in Potohars back in 1980's with minor tweaks for CNG and fuel consumption. Over the passage of time Suzuki has hardly made any interior/exterior change. Car prices are constantly rising and its price started around 5 Lacs is not at 8,21,000 Rs which is not worth the product and you may opt for Imported Car in this range and even lower.The handling is a nightmare on its Stock tyres, and the car is also extremely stiff and bumpy. So changing to softer and wider tyres is recommended, which will make a lot of difference in its comfort and grip. The car will handle fine till 80kms; above that and you will feel like losing it. It comes with hydraulic steering system which is acceptable for the reason that EPS at high speeds due to high steering sensitivity will become a risk.Interior wise this car has sub standard build quality and squeaks from a new car are nothing new. Recently they changed the traditional cassette player to JVC CD/mp3 Player. The seats are a little uncomfortable specially while turning when the body roll takes over and you literally start moving to the sides. The A/C works just fine if not good.Exterior wise the looks still come from the 90's and nothing has been upgraded; it even does not have rear screen defrostThe positive point is its spare parts. They are as cheap as anything and you can get them from almost everywhere at some serious cheap price. So driving in traffic takes the edge off you.Economy on CNG is around 4Rs/Litre while on Petrol with A/C; local it would hardly give you 12km, on Long route it increases to 14km/l which is still not acceptable for 1000cc Carby engine.This cars engine has been discontinued worldwide and recently this model was taken off the chart from Suzuki Pakistan.\n",

            "I have recently bought the 2012 altis 1.6 A/T.I find this car good in eficiency giving about 12km/liter.The cruise control feature is very handy on the motorway,by the way no local made cars have this feature.Ground clearance is much better than Gli,Xli,Civic,and City.Performance wise not my favorite car,wish the older 1.8ltr version was still availible.I also notice the Rpm reaching to 3 when cruising speed is about 120km.The engine is more quiter than xli/gli.Should have steering wheel audio or temprature controls.One thing that disturbs me is that in the sunroof version there is a lot less headroom compared to xli/gli/civic.The driver and passanger seats are comfortable but the rear seat should have a bit more leg room.The plastic mirors and plastic door handles are removed like in the gli/xli.The door from the interior gives a quite classy look with leather.The dashbord is full of plastics,and does not give the premium feel when adjusting the A/C.Toyota should have had dual airbags,as the Altis is only having one for the driver.Having some minor hold backs,but overall best car in the market.\n",

            "It is interesting to see Honda being compared to Toyota on Pak Wheels. It is just like comparing BMW to Suzuki. Only people who do not know how to control the car find Honda suspension troublesome. Poor drivers just cannot drive Honda. They can only drive Toyota. Since it is falling apart from the first day any day.Even Mehran puts in better quality interior than Toyota Pakistan. The seating length and width is sufficient enough to hold a two year old in Toyota. And don't forget when you reach 60KM/Hour it seems as if Toyota is going to be blown away by the wind and you feel as if you are going in a donkey cart instead of a car. Now on the other hand check out the interior of even City leave alone Civic and you will know what class is. The faster you go the smoother the drive is. Corolla is just alot of rolla!\n",

            "Hello everyone.I am living in norway and i had to buy car for my parents living in lahore. I had a tough situation to get through. Here in norway swift is a hit. I decided to go against advice of lots of people(which obviously was to buy toyota or honda) i decided to experiment and bough suzuki swift. I drove it and just kept on driving i fell in love with this spectacular machine as response and overall quality was awesome. No other car in pakistan comes with so much pre loaded gadgets. Keyless entry,Power mirrors,power steering,power windows,power cooling (AC is super cool)smooth gear shifting,bridge stone tyres,good sound system(no need for aftermarket expense on replacing sound system as it give you decent and enough bass to enjoy your journey) and last but not least ABS features makes it one hell of mean machine. Accelaration is the best part of this machine. Love its engine sound as it sounds compact and crispy whenever u press accelarator. Dint spend alot of money after purchasing just paid for poshish and mats and nothing else. Although little tight in diggy but one is not always on a road trip. Well compiled package by pak suzuki this time in a good price. Hats off to suzuki guys for giving us suzuki swift and breaking traditionaly duopoly of honda and toyota.\n",

Corolla and City 2008-20012 is very light car having very less road grip. u won't enjoy it after having civic. plus city and Corolla 2009-2012 has no anti-theft (immobilizer) system in it where as civic has. U will be care free after buying civic. i am suggesting u coz recently i have seen 3 cases of steeling brand new Corollas and city. even Swift or  Liana is better then city and corolla in security system.2. There is not much difference of economy between city and civic. i.e Corolla and city gives 14 to 15 km/liter in city, where as civic manual transmission gives 11-12km/liter in city. so there is not much difference in economy if u compare the class of cars..\n",

            "This review is intended for sharing my point of view regarding the Civic and Axio. An individual in one of the reviews below has asked for opinions, so here's mine.The civic no doubt looks better, has a little more spacious interior and a more powerful engine giving it the edge in performance. The build quality however, is certainly not going to match the standards of the japanese.While the Civic is made locally and purchasing it will give a boost to the economy of our dear country, sadly the quality control agency seems to be asleep as most of the parts and bits are very very cheap for a saloon costing nearly 20 lacs. The Axio is going to be much better in the terms of build quality and ride refinement. This is because it is brought re-conditioned and is japanese assembled. The latest model with the new head-lamps and tail-lights is very good looking.This great website will help with the latest prices of each model and i guess both these cars are mostly in the same range. The axio may be less expensive in some cases, depending upon the model year and condition.To summarize:>The advantages of Civic:. Style. Spacious and hi-tech interior.. Performance. Spare parts availability>The problems with Civic:.  fuel efficient.. Average build quality>The advantages of Axio:. Solid build quality. Efficient Engine. Excellent ride, sound insulation and refinement>The problems with Axio:. Spare parts difficult to find.. Second Hand value is poor (High Depreciation). A bit bland in styling department.I hope this is helpful :).\n",

            "I had always been a fan of corolla and have driven the following models quite frequently, 82, 86, 2001(indus), 2005, 2006(2d saloon) and 2010(new shape). one thing i must admit and im sure few of u will disagree with me, over the the years corolla has lost its credibility and the present model is crap. the 2002-2007 model had serious stability issues and the driver side power window malfunctions on every second model, the new corolla is no good either. stability has improved but it has sluggish acceleration, interior is old school, new steering and accelerator system is also a failure as it has lag. and i also dont understand why corolla makes this roundish type car designs....... then one day i decided not to follow my brain and went for my heart. i bought a honda civic eagle eye UG and afterwards a reborn vti oriel prosmetic. i think my driving experience has changed manifold here are my pros and consPROS1. Extremely hitech interior2. Very responsive engine ( faster than altis 1.8)3. Quality material used4. Very nice handling and cornering5. superb design, with sharp angles giving it a mean look6. steering and throttle are very responsiveCONS1. Its a bit fuel hungry2. Spares are costly3. maint is a bit costly i once had a race with a corolla altis and by the time the car shifted to third i cud see the altis 1.8 in my rear view mirror, in short i would advise for those hooked up on rollas, just drive a honda and see what you have been missing\n",

The important plus point of my ride is that it will not disappoint me as far as money is concerned when i sell it as it has got best resale value. The only negative i have noticed so far is its seats .They should have been more comfortable. Over all a best car with dashing looks and best resale .\n",

            "We all know that the Honda Civic is entitled to be more sporty and performance oriented than its chief rival, the Toyota Corolla. This holds even more truth when the styling is compared, both on the exterior and the interior. While the Corolla seems to have a bland design and resembles a piece of lard, the Civic looks space-age and coupe-ish in its approach.It is quite a heated debate this, b/w these two and the other day i was lucky enough to sit in both of these cars and have to say while the Corolla may seem to be boring and dull, the ride was far more comfortable. The noise insulation was very good and though the interior seems basic, it was airy and a pleasant place to sit.On the other hand, the Civic could only keep me attracted towards its digital speedo-meter and glitzy dashboard for a few minutes. After a few kms, i could feel every bump and stone on the road. It was as if the car was deliberately trying to feedback everything. This sensation is good in a sports car with two seats and one that is made for handling from the ground up. The Civic however, is a family saloon and the suspension setup has clearly been more tuned towards the firm side, approaching a hard ride. I don't have an idea of which car has the more interior space, but while Corolla was airy, the Civic felt as if you had sunk in the seats. I almost had to stand to look at the vast bonnet.To conclude, i'd say that buy the Corolla if you travel alot and want to be comfortable munching the motorway miles. But it will no doubt make you look uninteresting and boring. And if you are young with hot blood in your veins and can withstand the appalling comfort of the Civic, don't look anywhere else.\n",

It has absolutely no underpinnings of a modern car, an ancient design with an aging gearbox and engine and no features whatsoever. Pathetic build quality coupled with the fact that the price keeps on increasing does not justify this car's value. over, the car has a serious lack in the safety department, with no crumple zones, airbags and safety belt that predate pre-historic times and structural integrity of a pepsi can. This car is utterly hopeless and fails to protect its occupant and people shouldn't consider buying this heap of junk at all.\n",

            "I have been using this car for more than 2.5 years, i still have it and i am still in love with this car.You wont get any better car in this price range.Let me explain my ratings based on my experience.1. Style: Although it is a copy of Chevrolette, but i like its style, specially when you see it from sides and back, i dont like its face :(2. This is very comfortable car, the leg and head room for all seats are very nice, you will find its rear seat even more roomier than Mehran, i have been driving it with four people on back seat without any problem. Its shock absorbing system is really nice and is far more better than Mehran, alto and Santro, you will find it very nice on rough roads also.3. Performance: Although it is 0.8 L car, it works really well with AC and on highways, i am not a speedy driver but still i catched up 135 with 6 persons and some kids (including driver). The previous owner was claiming that he ran it even for 150 on motorway.4. Value for Money: This is the best car i can find in this price range.5. Fuel Economy: I am normally getting 13 inside city and 15 on highways, and that is little better as compared to Mehran or Alto, but less than Vitz.6. Overall: If you have a limited budget and you want something good, you can go for this car, you will find good features in this car, its power steering, power locks, AC, have RPM meter, rear wiper, fog lights (front and rear), automatic window closing on remote lock, and very secure (if it is remote locked, it wont start unless remote unlocked, even with its own key, the software actually locks the engine).Thanks\n",

            "Posted by khanSH on Jun 20, 2012\n",
            "Have owned the car for over an year now and the positives and negatives i've experienced thus far are as as follows:Positives:1. Appearance. Especially with nice 16 inch wheels and low profile tires it has the rare ability to look cool and classy at the same time. 2. A/C: Fantastic air conditioning. One year in, even in the 48C afternoons, it makes me shiver. 3. Fuel Economy. Does about 14 on the Motorway and about 10 in the city per litre. That's not amazing or anything but decent enough for a car this size and with such outdated technology. 4. Comfort. Long drives are not a problem! Especially with the cruise control going back and forth between lahore and isloo in a day is more of a pleasure than a pain. 5. ECO feature. Its has made me change my driving habits. Now i'm always on the hunt for the little green light to light up on my dashboard to let me know that i'm driving in an efficient manner. Used to drive like a teenager on crack, but not anymore. Negatives:1. Build Quality: its just over all a shabby job. The cheap plastic on the dash creeks and groans like a 90 year old woman. When you pay upwards of 2 million for a vehicle you deserve better. 2. Performance: I will never understand why the 1.6 litre hasn't been provided a 5-speed auto transmission. You can tell every time you rev the engine that it has the potential for greatness but the horrible gear box strangles it every time. With ridiculously wide gear ratios you end up with a tiny 500 rpm range of peak power in each gear while the rest of the range is reserved for making noise and looking stupid. Its such a let down! 3. Handling: a boy racer this ain't! Its slow and cumbersome in corners, the steering is light and fluffy like pudding. There are ships out there more nimble than this car. Of course that means a somewhat more comfortable driving expereince but for those looking for responsiveness and that ever illusive fun factor that honda and even Suzuki seem to get right sometimes, the Altis disappoints. 4. Sound. The engine wheezes and wails like an old, sick cat. Of course you don't expect ferrari like symphony from a family sedan but still, the engine should at least sound as good as it looks and this sounds horrible.5. Stock General Tires: they call em eurostar now but don't be fooled, they are still the same crappy general tires that couldn't grip a road paved with samad bond. Change them ASAP. 6. Horribly Stupid Foot rest: yest it has a so called foot rest for the driver but instead of it being where the clutch is in a manual car, its stuck way off to the left and at an angle that actually requires you to contort your foot into a most inhuman position just to reach it. Its more like foot torture than foot rest. Overall:Despite the negatives, its still a comforting car to own. I enjoy driving it in the same way one enjoys a nice hot shower on a cold january night. Its soothing and calming rather than energizing and exciting. if you enjoy the art of driving and like your cars to be responsive, quick and with a bit of a fighting spirit. This car is not for you. If on the other hand, you just want to get from point A to point B hassle free and comfortably, go for the Altis and it won't disappoint.\n",

The EPS (Electronic Power Streeing) does a great job, infact it is much lighter than any car on the current market. the Navigation System and DVD Audio System works a breeze. Touch enabled, it is easy to handle and very visible. The turn by turn navigation is a wonder in a country like pakistan.the leather interior and soft suspension make it very comfortable. the outside noise is considerably decreased. i found it very fuel efficient, giving me round about 13 km/l in city. one con i founf was that it lacks the Bucket Seats of civic. and generally you can find the cheap made plastic in the dash area.overall, a best buy!\n",

            "Mandi Bahauddin: Suzuki dealers in Punjab  are looting customers under the cover of  registration and freight charges of vehicles. A customer who booked Suzuki Mehran said that Suzuki Dealers Jhelum  received Rs 21000 as registration charges and Rs 15000 as freight charges on delivery of vehicle. He said he requested the dealers to give him vehicle documents and he would get the vehicle registered with Mandi Bahauddin Excise Department but  the dealer refused to oblige him telling that it was Suzuki Company policy that dealers would get the vehicle registered.  He also refused to register vehicle with Mandy district and registered vehicle at Jhelum, a station of his own choice. Excise authorities when contacted told that registration for Suzuki Mehran was near about Rs 15000. Regarding freight charges no bill giving details was shown to him. The customer further told that attitude of dealers after booking a vehicle grows harsh and they dictate their own terms. About quality of Suzuki he said its several parts were not fitted properly. Rear and front bumpers were tilting downward. Leaf springs of rear suspension were not in proper alignment. Interior holstry, vinyl and lining of doors were not properly fixed. Wheels balancing and vehicle alignment were not satisfactory. AC which costs Rs 52000 gives poor cooling and runs heavy. On first inspection, faults observed were pointed out to mechanics who said that these faults were caused by poor and bad workmanship at the factory while assembling the vehicle. It may be mentioned that Suzuki Mehran is a vehicle that people with low income purchase. Under Yellow Cab Scheme this vehicle is sold on easy installments to selected persons at price one lakh cheaper as compared to those who purchase through booking. This disparity in price is unjustified.Sher Gondal\n",

            "Posted by Ibrahim Khattak on May 03, 2012\n",
            "A month back i had an option to Buy a car for myself. It could have been anything Gli, City, Vitz, Belta. Basicly anything with a small engine. :D . So after much thought i went for the Suzuki Swift. I had never driven it before, and sat in it once when it was newly launched. When i picked it from the showroom i was expecting it to be a typical Suzuki. BUT was in for a surprise. The 1.3 Dohc is one mean machine. The power Delivery is BIG, it simply goes crazy . I agree its not like Gli in terms of fuel consumption but it covers that with the fun factor when u floor the pedal. :D . The ABS does what it is supposed to do, the breaks are responsive. The ride compared to the City is MUCH better, City is known for its hard seats. But the Swift is comfortable on long drives and on bumpy roads.         When one thinks about SUZUKI the word BAD QUALITY instantly comes to ones head. But in the Swift its diffrent . The build quality is impressive. Suzuki has left no loose ends, both from the inside and out. The Air Conditioning is as they say CHILLLING :D  The leg rooom happens to be excellent for a person of good build and height i.e 6Foot and 80kgs .        People may say that 12 Lakhs is TOO much for a Suzuki or rather a small car. But the thing is its not a small car, its a hatchback!!!! What car gives u Alloy Rims, Keyless Entry, Fog Lamps, Power Windows and Adjustable SideView Mirrors in 12 lakhs and that to Zero Meter. The tires supplied by suzuki are good Bridgestones, not the EURO STAR that come with Honda and Toyota. A good stereo Supplied by Alpine which complements the whole dashboard and completes its look. Impressive, no.?        You the reader might say im going on showering praises on the car cause i own it myself. No thats not the case , im telling from experience as i have owned or happend to drive its competitors and yes the Swift has its flaws. Its heavy on fuel. But it does give 11km/l and above with normal city driving. And i happend to notice it does have UnderSteer, maybe its the way i drive but it does tend to messup a bit in the corners. Another FLAW i noticed is that the car is low, when at full capacity driver has to be carefull on the speed breakers. The resale value on the other hand is considerd to be LOW when taking into account other cars.      Thats about everything i have to say about the car. In looks its small , Drives like a big car and goes like one aswel . I personaly do not promote rash driving but in times of need or emergncy the swift is perfectly capable of doing 170km/h on the Moterway . Tried and tested to 175km/h. I hope my article helps you in deciding on the car if your intrested :))\n",

It averages about 12 - 13 in the city where there are a lot of traffic hazards and stuff like that. On highways it is superb . It averaged 17km/l on highway with continuous ac on.  and fuel economy does depend upon the weight of the car and the number of people sitting in the car. In my case there were 5 people sitting in the car. Interior of the car is not up to the mark. It is average . Overall it is a very good car. The exhaust sound is also superb ( can not compare it with Honda city ). And people who want to buy corolla xli , my advice to them is that they should go for honda city..\n",

            "My new swift Dlx was delivered yesterday. I had many concerns as I have been suzuki products for more than 15 years, But when I looked at exterior, interior & specially drive its not near suzuki. Its unbelieving  more than I expected from suzuki! The package price is bit more than cultus for which I had initially opted, but its sporty look, road grip as good as city, ABS, alloys imported tires,fogs,power pack, quality audio system & most of all its looks hatchback & smallish but its driving ease, grip & performance all matching any perfect new sedan.Well I can not predict about fuel economy as I have not driven it much. The other negative is lack of proper trunk , but its still useful for little bit luggage. The other comparision is Vitz, but its definitely used one with expensive parts. I will say this car is the best issue of Suzuki Pakistan so far, I can suggest if trunk is not considered of supreme priority, swift DLX is much better choice than XLI/GLI/city         Now it has been driven about 3300km, the fuel economy is average. 3s says it will improve after 5000km. It is giving me about 11 -12 in city & it consumed 1.25 tanks from Abbottabad to Lahore(about1000km) & back with A/C , on Motorway & speed of 120km/h with occasional 140 for overtaking, so its fine.It has great power & it easily touched 170plus on motorway.\n",

The interior is not of good quality. The engine makes very much sounds. The car applies too much force on the engine when going uphill and cultus has larger body as compared to alto and they both have the same engine of 1000cc. So i think that altois cheaper and better than cultus. Instead of buying a new cultus worth 925,000 you can buy 2004-5 model corolla or honda city.

Still Civic is being sold at a remarkably higher price then Corolla,s all variants and is the choice of executive class. why?Comfort: I think its a naturally proven fact that suspension of Honda has ever been much better and comfortable than Corolla. People who have driven it, know itPerformance: Acceleration of both the cars(Civic and ALTIS) is Excellent but one Honda has is a bit more stableVFM: Both the cars are too much expensive.....Fuel Economy: I've personally driven Civic 15.2 KM/ Liter of fuel. Corolla 1300 cc drives less than it.Interior: Honda has a stylish interior since 2006 with a strong, luxurious, Elegant and Inspiring finish. Corolla never hadRoad Grip: Civic has a better road grip due to its unique body designSpecial Features: Availability of some standard as well as some optional features give Civic superiority over Corolla likeDigital SPEEDO,Small Sporty Steering, Great Audio System with built in 6 CD changer/ Navigation, Leather seats, rear reading lamps and Anti- Theft system etcOverall:              Civic V/S corolla oh sorry Rolla has no comparison\n",

I got 13 to 15 in pindi driving and on GT road it gave me 16 to 17. This fuel avg has been calculated after refilling the tank. SR is good and works fine. Only draw back is its braking problem. It is too sensitive. May be im not used to it because previously i had idsi 06. It just stops when u slightly apply the breaks. Pick is very nice and gear shifting is smooth. Cabin is reasonably sound less due to change of new tyres. i got michelin. these r better than yokohama db. Potential buyers can compare this car with civic in terms of drive and steering controls but can not cross the interior pattern of civic. For family persons who remain conscious of milage i can guarnttee its really a good deal even my idsi before conversion to cng was not giving more than 14. so with a heavier engine and much better acceleration than all other cars its a good option.  over new buyers who have to park their cars for longer duration must get suitable anti theft system. i may insure it but at the moment short of money. now using steering lock and mob alert system developped by my friend which sends sms if some one fiddles with the steering but it is a temporary solution.

Minimum 1500cc engine is required for good performance. it is of great resemblence with typical pak assembled car that its silver panneleing on door n besides ac vents is of so poor quality that a nail causes scratch on it which looks v bad. its pic is not so good even on petrol. there is only a small difference between pic of cultus n corolla. the good thing in ecotec is that its cng connection is supplied separately to all 4 cylynders of car  which does not effect pic on gas .  n ecotec engine is specially for cng. it covers about 11 km wid ac in city n 13 to 14 on long routes wd ac. if u drive in city between 60 to 70 km/h then it will cover 13 km in a litre. in a 60 litr cylynder it goes abot 160 km wdout ac in city n 200  above on long routes.\n",

            "New corolla comes with lots of versions. 1.3L is underpowered, 1.8L consumes more fuel. But 1.6L Super ECT is best car in the corolla range. It has perfect balance of power and fuel economy. Plus Super ECT has smoother shifts, more fuel economy and delivers good performance, based on two modes, power and normal. To know more about Super ECT check this link:  www.autoshop101.com/forms/h16.pdfover, this car was designed in Italy, and has more space and amazing looks, even better than Camry. Very balanced shape and comes with standard ABS. inside stereo comes with USB port and fuel meter. Only drawback of this car is that it is very expensive as compare to 1.3L models, and price is not justified for 1.6L engine and Automatic transmission. Plus CNG installation may be a problem in this car, because of complex tuning issue. If you can afford this car as it is, it is best choice in the country in 1.6L cars, since only Suzuki Liana is the other model which comes in 1.6L engine and automatic transmission.\n",

It also has the fuel meter which helps the driver to look at the average fuel consumption, per liter consumption and range of the fuel left in the tank. Plus it comes with standard ABS.

            "Mine arrived six months back and I must say I am disappointed. Yes disappointed at manufacturers like Toyota, Honda and the likes. The Swift turns out to be a direct and ruthlessly angry stare in the eyes of the other 1.3 liter counterparts.Positives of swift are certainly a lot more than the Negatives. For Instance the Alloy wheels, Imported Tires, Power/window-mirror-steering, and the worthiest mention ABS add great value to the overall package that one pays for. A relatively decent sound system with only one downside (The speakers buzz at high bass levels, obviously on high volumes). The car overall pays-off fairly well given the amount spent.Before i forget to assert on the ridiculous mileage, let me just add that the kind of power swift delivers would certainly bear a price tag that comes in the form of high fuel consumption. But then again the power delivered through the 1.3 liter mechanical piece of art justifies that to a great extent. I have managed to attain a 10km/l mark within the city, which is decent. Fill the tank and a one-side sprint on motorway can be done in a little more than half a tank equating it to around 18km/l.I have had a chance to manage a pocketful of road tickets on motorway for speeding, but my toe just wouldn’t ease without flooring the gas pedal. Crank it, kill it and knock the 175 km/h barrier fairly easily. And by the way I love doing that. I heardGreat work Suzuki. Simply love it.\n",

NOT VALUE FOR MONEY IT IS RUBBISH SO CALLED SUV.\n",

            "Posted by Moiz Husain on Jan 25, 2012\n",
            "Got mine in the 1st week of January. Since it was the first Suzuki in the family, I was a little skeptical on how things would turn out. The first 500kms have been alhamdulillah satisfying. The fuel average that I got (that's after the 1st refilling of the tank) is 12.98 km/l. I've seen people saying it doesn't give more than 9-10 initially but 12.98 is what I got. This includes extra urban (traffic jams) as well as straight roads mostly with no a/c since it’s winter. The new integrated in-dash is a nice touch. The volume knob is so easy to operate just like the one in the Vti-Oriel. Since mine is to be used as a second car (self use only with primary commuting to office and home), I was initially planning for the DX version but the additional 100 grand it worth the dough. Keyless entry is a must and so is ABS and Alloys ad a little glamour to the overall silhouette of the body.If budget is not a problem, the DLX is the one to go for. Nonetheless, Suzuki should be commended to provide basic amenities like PW and Central locking in the base version. Not to mention imported tyres too.Things I don’t likeThere is no assist grip for the driver and there are no jacket hangers at the rear assist grips. The steering despite being electrically assisted feels a like heavier than my steermatic’s. And it isn’t as precise either. Legroom at the rear is virtually non-existent and people with families should look at other options too.Overall a nice package and good value for money.\n",

            "It’s only a looker. Some real facts are that the body size is too big for a 1.3 unit to handle, it’s extremely underpowered, lack of torque is common feeling if you are living in North. Poor quality of interior, specially the door panels. Previously made in Pakistan shape had much better quality than this. No ABS, No airbags, manual windows common. Then you don’t have peace of mind with corolla, thief loves to lift them… I don’t say Honda City is a better option or that crampy Swift can help your cause, reality is that given the choices we have among the newer cars, it’s just a selection between worst!\n",

            "I read several reviews, some people like,  some doesn't like it all. After reading some reviews I am confused.  I have asked my relative to buye me Cultus with CNG. Since I will be visiting Pak in few weeks. I am sure In few days arrangements  will be made for buying new Cultus with factory fitted CNG.I live in USA and will be using this car few weeks a year on my visit to Pak. I know in 2009 Suzuki offered power stearing, alloy wheels, fog lights and power windows previously.To my disappointment these accessories are not being offered now. I want a car with dual fuel factory fitted CNG, not after market install.As far as I know, right now Toyota and Suzuki  are they only ones. Offers petrol and CNG in few models. Choices is very limited in Pak for dual fuel. I like Toyota crolla with factory fitted CNG, but driving few weeks in a year doesn't justify to spend close 18 grands. So I decided to go far Cultus 2011.Though it's 2012 but still in Pak market 2012 Cultus is not available yet. I don't understand why is that. Here in USA 2012 models were available in Sept. every year.I visited Pak Suzuki web site and was very disappoined. Very minimal informations were available about their freking products. Under specification  O is written. I thought it mean \"optional\" . It should have been S \"Standard\".Any way I would like to ask this forum. When new models of cars comes in market. Such as 2012.

Coming back to alto, its an amazing car in a cheap price range. Its driving is so smooth like a luxurious car. The interior is perfect, sides are covered with plastic material. Brakes work fine below speed of 80. Engine is powerful. Car can be easily turned in a small space. A/C is great. It gives good mileage on CNG as compared to Petrol. I think this car has no comparision with coure or mehran. You can say Coure is an improved version of Mehran.Howevere there are some negative things as well. The engine of alto is a bit noisy. Road grip in not soo good with the tyres fitted by suzuki. The car starts a little bit shaking above speed of 85.Apart from that, Alto  would be an extra superb car if suzuki has installed power steering, power windows and ABS in it.Overall its a perfect car.\n",

            "Best buy for money and have all the features that you wish your car should have. It is a little pricey though but the current devaluation of PAK currency against Dollar is a big factor of it that is just understandable. Let me share some quick in-sights about New Corolla Altis 2011-12. I am sure it will help other potential buyers to have a detail review before actually making their minds to purchase it.Economy Drive--------------------To me the most promising thing is the economy and mileage of new Altis. I have recorded more than 15.8KMs/L mileage so far which is just awesome for a 1.6L car. //Please note that I have not installed CNG in my car so have no information about the mileage and acceleration on CNG. All the ratings and mileage I have shared above is recorded on petrol driving6 Forward Gears and Driving Experience at High Speeds-----------------------------------------------------------------------------As you know that new Altis M/T comes with 6 forward gears and the reverse gears is applied in the upward direction (left-top) where 1st forward gear is applied. The 6th gear is a great addition, i must say because when you are driving at ~100 speed and apply the 6th gear. Your cars comes to ease and the loudness of engine settles down. The car becomes light to give you a peaceful and comfortable driving experience even at higher speeds.Improved Braking System-----------------------------------The breaking system with ABS is another good factor to discuss which is lot more improved than previous shaped Corollas.Pick and Acceleration-----------------------------Acceleration is also great and your car picks up speed accordingly as you press the pedal. This is my first move from a 1.3L car to a big engine and I have felt a lot of difference is pace, speed, drive and handling of this new Altis which performs great in all of these aspects.Move your Car Gently, Anywhere-------------------------------------------The EPS (Electronic Power Steering) is a MUST HAVE feature to be discussed. The steering wheel is so light and works like a breeze. It asks just a finger note to turn/move your car.Interior Quality-------------------Overall, the interior quality is just above average and should have been improved. This is what a genuine buyer must think when he buys a new Corolla. The interior is a little hard and the leg room on driver side needs to be a little more widen to keep your legs rested in ease, especially on long journeys.Final Verdict-----------------Finally, Corolla Altis is a great buy, comfortable and offers great features that othr competitors like Honda are offering at a high price, comparatively!Loving my Corolla Altis M/T(Reviewed by Usman Khawaja)My LinkedIn Profile: http://pk.linkedin.com/in/usmansarfraz\n",

Though i have seen worse, much better than many Pakistani cars/vans. (and it has LOTS of SPACE! ) that's all that matters, i guess.. Consumption: On CNG its fairly cheap. Specially on long drives. On petrol its a bit expensive cause of the extra power due to the weight. But i'd prefer driving it on petrol all the time as its totally at a different comfort level on petrol! (though i don't pay for either, so i guess my opinion doesn't matter. My dad pays and he says its good on CNG :P ) Now to the other things that matter, Power: it has lots of power! the 1.5L engine is just about the right size for this vehicle. Safety: Here is where the APV looses most of its points. It has NO ABS! That really is the worst part. NO AIRBAGS! The tires, play an important role in keeping the car stable. if you change them to bigger ones, you might increase the comfort but decrease the stability! its fairly stable, as a teenager like me hasn't killed himself yet, using the vehicle. So its stable till that extent. Though after a few years it will be very risky to drive it over 120 km/h on the Motorway or anywhere for that matter, as it wobbles, and feels very unsafe. Practicality: It is the best car in this section. It has LOTS of space for ANY type of luggage.. Though the CNG cylinder does take a bit of space in the back, there is still room to put two big bags behind the rear seats. You can easily fit 10 people in it. Though the people at the back will be a bit squeezed. Add one of those roofs to it and your luggage problem for these ten people is solved. (if each person has a bag ) Overall, it is one of the best Cars/Vans i've seen in Pakistan. And in this price range any other vehicle of it's type can not compete with it. Though if you can manage the cost of fuel, i'd suggest getting a Prado or Pajero.. As they are more fun to drive and has way more power plus comfort. Only problem would be they'd be old and the APV would be brand new.\n",

            "Sir, in that case and according PAMA Suzuki Mehran has a sale of 14,134 units and while Dahatsu cuore sold only 1728 units. So according to your equation what mehran would be a better car then cuore wouldn't it be? You don't compare cars from their selling ratio. You compare them from their performance, value for money and services given in them. Now why toyota has more sales. Look first of all I don't think that anybody rational would say that Liana is better than corrolla that's a fact whether anybody admits it or not. And selling of more units is because of having the great reselling price and most of all the durability this car is offering, no other car even honda is giving it to its users. Great shocks with good life of engine even in rural areas. That's why its competing. If you look for value of money, meaning the price you are paying for the services you are getting, Sir you have to admit that Liana will get more rating. 1.2 M and it gives you everything that 1.4 M Xli doesn't give and 1.55 M Gli do gives you with an additinal abs, Thats it.\n",

            "I purchased 0 meter liana in 2008 and have driven almost more then 100000 kms. Its a good car no doubt but it has many flaws. It do has a missing problem. You do have to press race on it before leaving the clutch meaning it needs proper combustion in its engine before you let the clutch go. its a car which gives you great pleasure while accelerating but stops your heart when it comes to brake. Suzuki should think about brakes even their abs system ain't very good, i don't have it but I do have reviews of many who have liana with abs. I was reading a review that missing problem on low gears in cng is pretty much high and he did alot to get out of it but nothing worked. I also experienced it, as I said it does that but there is a point it starts doing it in a very intolerable manner. The problem is with the coils. change them and you will find a huge difference in it. But original coils are very expensive. A set of those is more then Rs 20,000. A korean manufactured coils taken from a reliable source would be a better choice.\n",

Everything from the seating position, to the location of the dash, and the digital speed meter, shows that a lot of thought went into the design process and the result is that the Honda Civic is one of the sharpest and eye catching cars out in the market today. In terms of suspension and cornering, the Civic is miles ahead of Corollas, Sunnys etc and is a pleasure to drive. The auto transmission shifts seamlessly and quietly, and the engine is very responsive in both city and highway driving. The best buy in the market today for Pakistani manufactured cars is the Civic reborn. Only change I recommend is to change to Michelin right away, instead of the crappy Euro Stars the dealers put on the car. Beyond that, you really dont need to do anything else to the car, just buy and drive, and have a smile on your face !\n",

Even the driver seating position is better than Alto.But the current price is inflated and at this price the sales will decline and I believe that the car will become obsolete by end of 2012. At current price it should come with power windows, Alloys with imported tyres, Better Instrument panel, Crystal back lights, Fog Lights. Rear screen wiper, and Defogger. Overall better styling.IMC really should have brought the newer version, which would be way better than Alto and could also challenge the Suzuki Swift, although Swift is in a different category (engine capacity 1300cc).\n",

            "It is the pioneer in sense that it is the only and only 1000 cc carburetor car at this time in the world.It has SJ-410 970 cc 4 cylinder carburated Engine. This engine was made by suzuki Japan in 1985 for Suzuki Jeeps and was used by paksuzuki for potohar jeep (The only discontinued model of Paksuzuki otherwise they never discontinue any vehicle like Mehran).This engine is fitted with a 5 speed gear box which is designed in such a way that its lower gear ratios are very close to each other because it was intended to be used in Jeep. However, when paksuzuki discontinued Potohar jeep they started to fit this engine in Alto. The body shape of this car is also running in some countries like Saudi Arabia etc., but not with this engine. Also this car in those countries has  not permission to come on motorways.It is due to this reason that some people observe and say that alto engine in very powerful and it climbs mountains with ease. It is true that it climbs mountains easily, even easier than cultus, but its power is same as that of cultus. it is just because of gear ratios. i would not mind if Napak Suzuki Motor Company fits jeep engine in  car, but at least they should have evaluated some dynamics. Since this engine is not for car. Due to misfit engine this car has it center of gravity near its center (which should be near front wheels) so turning this car at high speed results in swing around center and loss of control or turn over of car upside down. Therefore this car is higly unstable on road at speeds above 90 km/hr. In this respect it is even worse than Mehran.you can say it FALTO.handling and drive of this car is good, but keep in mind it is not safe at high speeds. Brakes of this car are good. But if you replace its stock tires otherwise paksuzuki install 145mm tread tires which have no surface area to grip the road. AC is good when the car is running at high speedsEngine does not become very hot or hard with AC, but cooling of AC is a problem. only front two passengers can travel in city with AC. It has no RPM meter. It fuel economy at CNG is good and at petrol approximately 12-16 km/l. Door trim of this car are very good made up of entire moulding with plastic which even suzuki is not offering in cultus.Ac knobs are rotary type which look good like sedan cars.Seats are not comfortable but not roasting like seats of Mehran.Inside space is insufficient especially for rear passengers. Body is good looking and compared to all other small cars of paksuzuki it is good value for money.\n",

            "Bought a silver Dlx yesterday and i must say, Paksuzuki has done a great job to ensure good quality.  The driving pleasue is immense. A noise-free cabin, good road grip, excellent pick-up, good handling and comfortable seating makes swift an instant hit as far as i am concerned. Can't say much about the fuel economy as yet. The braking isn't as good as as i was hoping. I have a 09 city and a 10 corolla gli  but with both the cars lacking alloy wheels, Japanese tires, key-less entry, fog lamps and a quality cd/mp3 players, Swift is a clear winner if storage space and large seating room is not a problem!\n",

            "The story narrated by ahmedhassan1 seems to be a dream or fantasy as it is absolutely impossible to drive 700+ km in only 42 litres and that too with AC. hmhmhmh. Average consumption cannot be more than 6-8 km per litre with ac at the most. As far as shape is concerned, it is not attractive. Rear side is made in such a way that it gives look of a frog. Secondly, it is not load bearing. Means if four normal person sit in it, the body almost starts touching the rear wheel. No room for luggage. If a CNG cylinder is installed, then 3-4k will have to be spent on suspension to support the weight.  Vitz is much better being Japanese assembled.\n",

            "If you are looking for luxury in a small package, this car is for you.Engine size is large and power to weight ratio is excellent. That is why even in Lahore heat and humidity, the AC cooling remains effective and pick is not affected by AC.Small goodies that add up to a lot include japanese tyres, jvc cd player, cup-holders, central locking, electronic keys (ignition impossible without original keys), powerful blower in the AC, good-sized boot (one standard size luggage item can stand in the same space, comparable to what you are left with if you install CNG in a city)Fuel economy is excellent. With a mix of motorway driving (120 constant, overtaking >130) and city driving, I am getting over 13kms on a litre. No vibrations in cabin etc till 150km/hr.Excellent value for money considering that for a similar price you only get a refurbished vitz with 300cc less engine or a 2 year driven city, which will start mechanical trouble in an year of use.\n",

It won car of the year award in nineteenth countries around the globe. I like this car very much because of its sporty,aggressive and graceful bodyshape. Assembling is of japanese standard not of local suzuki. It is spacious and powerful enough to take on long route. Suzuki should bring more variety like SX4 1.6 Grand Vitara XL-7 V6 and  Kizashi 2.4 to have a respectable place in the market against the competitors.\n",

            "Hi Guys,I purchased Alto VXR cng in Aug 2010, now its one year completed. I drove it 26000 kms so far, was just only changing oil and filter. I am not saying teh car is immaculate but one has to see the over all raise in price for all the cars in Pakistan. Santro is not cheaper, neither the Cuore so over all you actually do not get the value for money but what options you are left with? its the cheapest amongst others with AC in it which is quote comfortable.I changed tires and installed Dunlop ECO, installed security system and seat covers, floor mats etc. Its reliable and never had any problem ALHAMDOLILLAH in long run. I took it to 150 Kms my self and though the engine was noisy but the drive was not like dangerous. Yes the breaking system is not that good, its average. Car do not have heating problem, until unless you fill the water bottle up to the mark full. Fuel consumption is not good but in CNG it goes to 250 kms in one full cylinder without ac, with ac its 150kms in local and 200 kms in long run. Gear conversion was tight but Suzuki dealer changes the gear oil at first 1000 kms free tuning, its better now. Engine is noisy because it has Potohar jeep's engine, but its more powerful on when you are driving it on mountains. Suzuki's over all quality assurance is worst so we can not say any of their model specifically is bad, what we get in cultus liana ? same door opening and closing issues - just an example. Car suspension is good enough and does not cause any noise if you drive it calmly in off road. We are left with no option if we have to buy a reliable family car which do not cause problem in long run, we have to buy mehran or alto, those who suggest to but second hand corolla or honda, do keep in mind that still they are second hand car and you can not rely on them when you are on motorway and surely do not like to face any technical issue with the car.For people who are planning to buy zero meter, I would suggest you either put some more money and buy some more luxurious car like Honda/  Corolla or buy this Alto VXR cng and do the following things.1. It will take long self because be default the tepats are tights, do not ask any mechanic to fix it, wait till 1st 1000 kms, than go for the dealer from where you have bought this car and they will adjust the tapets, starting will get superb undoubtedly.2. Do the cng setting and convert to cng after driving 1000 kms first on petrol.3. Ask the service manager to change or check gear oil so gear conversion gets soft.4. Change tires, general tires sucks and also harms the suspension as they are very hard. Go for Japenese Dunlop (suggested)5. Do the balancing and wheel alignment.6. Do not over fill the water bottle, my car only reduces 2% water from the bottle, DO NOT OVER FILL THE BOTTLE, keep it up to the mark - FULL.7. Change oil and filter every 4,000 kms either Zic or Caltex havoline, or shell.8. While washing, put plastic on the distributor to avoid any starting problem.9. Avoid taking it to the mechanic for pick or cng consumption, let the car settle down for 10,000 KMs, sometimes its cng quality which causes car do have the require pick up. (I did two tunings till 26,000 KMs.)10. If you need any more information, contact me on my email - [email protected]Thanks!\n",

Keep an eye on the front there cuz the new honda civic (already available in the middle east and coming soon in pakistan) is gonna have a very very similar front. Smooth as silk. Slightly hard suspensions but on urban and long routes, its seamless. great looking interior. Cheapest brand new Automatic car here in Pakistan. I love its rear cuz it looks quite similar to BMW 318. Some people say they dont get a reasonable fuel economy nothing above 7 or 8 km/l, please get your city completely checked by honda. You should get 11-13 in the city in summers, around 16 on the motorway and around 18 on GT rd. THis is a very well balanced car in terms of the drive. It gives you immense control over your drive. Thanks to that, I have avoided a lot of hard situations, accidents. Nice queit i-vtec 1.3 engine that gives you reasonable enough power. On automatic transmission, it might seem a little less at times but a more expert drives can take out more power from it. I would never sell it had I been staying in Pakistan.  Its a keeper!\n",

            "Hi Guys,The speed meter lights in the new corolla Xli & Gli are Orange Colour while in the previous model of the Xli/ Gli the lights were White which were more cool. Since i kept the older version of Se-Saloon as well as Altis therefore when i bought the new Xli, I was disappointed to see the Orange Lights Display which totally runied my night driving experience of this car. I then opened the Speed Meter of my brand new Corolla and i saw very small Square Shaped LEDs in the Speed Meter. I searched in the market for white LEDs of same size, shape and ampere. After thorough searching i found only one electronic shop  who had similar LEDs of white light. I then purchased those LEDs and soldered them into my Corolla Speed meter. After that when I installed the meter back into the Car and turned on the Parking Light Switch I was amazed to see the Display. I Looked extremely beautiful just like the Speed Meter in the Altis. It even looked much much better than the White Lights in the Previous Model of Xli/ Gli. I could not attach the pictures of my speed meter on this page but any of you guys who are interested in  changing the colour of their speed meter lights can contact me on [email protected] for more  information.Thanks\n",

            "Guys, this is my second review on Corolla Xli (mine is 2010). First review was a couple of months after I had purchased.Today its ODO is 9,300km. After a trip to Naran/Jalkhad from Lahore last month, I have noticed that its drive is more lighter and smoother and fuel consumption has improved. Perhaps Xli needs a hard push on the pedal and I do not put much load on the pedal; but I did as needed in the mountains and I think engine has started responding well after completing 9000 km. Gear lever was hard as well, now its smooth.After a lot of punishment on the road from Kawai to Jalkhad re broken roads, no road, passing the glaciers, streams, wooden bridges....... when I returned to Lahore, I was surprsied that there was not even a single noise in the cabin; this proves that xli is a strong machine... yes its doors have some weight. I had also purchased a zero meter city in 2004 and within one month of purchase, I was surprised with the nosies in the cabin....... its pick up was not better than current Xli.No need to buy a Gli if you are satisfied with black color. I paid Rs. 20,000 and installed power windows, security system, central locking and back brake light.However, for someone who is considering buying this machine, please note that body is heavy compared to 1300 cc engine dragging it and I think CNG (if installed) will kill the pick up. This situation is compensated with aggressive looks. But brakes are still horrible.... I think, it will get out of control even at 80. I am also not staisfied with the instrument panel.... Toyota is still using the old fashioned instrument panel..... brown color background light is so boring and I still feel that I am driving a 1996 model Corolla.Hope this helps!\n",

            "The New Honda City is not a car to waste 1.4 Million Rupees. The Car is hugely overpriced in Pakistan. in the other parts of the world it serves as a middle class car as it is sold in only Thailand, Pakistan and India. Only the Pakistani market of New Honda City is higher as compared to other countries where it is mostly purchased by middle class people who cant afford to buy a much bigger car like the Corolla. In Pakistan, due to its excessive price, people have started to compare it with Corolla Xli or Even a Gli, which is a mistaken anomaly. Xli and Gli are a car in the Compact Class category having wider Wheel Base while City is a Sub-Compact Car. No where in the World does a sub-compact car is compared with a Compact Car. This is due to this simple science that a bigger car is always more attractive, expensive and of higher category than a smaller car. For example You cannot Compare a Camry with Altis or u cannot compare a Accord with Civic. The former cars are more huge and more expensive and they are meant for the  Elite Class. Similarly, corolla is purchased by a higher class people in the world while City is desgined for the middle class people due to its Sub-Compact Category.So the bottom line is that City is not the car to be compared with the Corolla as bigger cars always attract the eye more than the smaller ones. So please stop comparing 2 cars of totally different category. If u wanna compare Corolla with City then u must buy a car of Compact Category such as the Civic.U can compare the New City with Toyota Belta and the Older Model City with Toyota Platz as both fall in sub-compact category.\n",

            "Lot has been said and heard about the comparison. The bottom line is.... Civic does not compare with Corolla, if at all, it should be compared with Altis.While Japanese did their best in producing this pure beauty (civic), and we Pakistanis destroyed it with our usual cheating.The body material is worthless, feels like crap, paint wears out with slightest touch and plastic...... man, it feels cheap like China toys.I don't know why we get carried away with this useless discussion of comparing Civic with Corolla and not stop for a second and demand quality form these blood suckers.Buying a car is no more a priviledge, as it once used to be. Its a commodity now...Wake up bros, lets behave like educated consumers. and chose betwen the ones who offer better quality, better service, and better customer relations.Choosing between \"teen-dabba\" will not get you there.\n",

            "All of you Civic Lovers please dont waist your energy in glorifying Civic against the Corolla. Just read the Blog on this website on the topic \"Honda from Hero to Zero\" in which the international consumer market have downgraded Civic as the least favourite car.The New Reborn Civic is just Crap cause its too hard and have sluggish acceleration as well as handling. Its too heavy. It feels like driving an old model Jeep. You people just dont get it that Dont compare Civic with Xli and Gli. Compare the Civic with Altis. The New Altis is luxurious to drive. It is very smooth where ever you drive be it on the blacktop or a rugged terrain. Civic has lost its market interest due to the fact that it is trying to make the car more and  more like a race car. This experiment by Honda has suffered huge failure which itself honda admits. Honda Civic is a Sedan and not a race car. A sedan should be comfortable to drive with family sitting. It should not break the back like you are sitting in an RX8.Toyota Z-Gen vvti Technology is a indigenous formula of Toyota Japan only which has rendered the Corolla much more smooth, responsive, fuel efficient and accelerating drive. Honda cannot copy the vvti technology due to copyrights infringement so it is trying to make its indigenous VTEC more smoother. This is not possible due to the unique design of VTEC engine. VTEC only works on High RPMs and it  only activates the intake valve. On the other hand VVT-i Technology works  at any range of RPM and it activates both the intake and exhaust valve simultaneously. The dual VVT-i in the New Altis is the example of that. Honda Civic has been beaten by Corolla due to more advanced engine technology which has made the New Corolla Altis as the Best Selling Car of the World and the United States. The wealthiest people live in the US and they prefer Corolla over Honda. Honda is not in the league of Corolla. So many of my friends who have written reviews on this page saying that u cannot compare Civic with Corolla may be right but in the 'Opposite Perspective'. If you wanna move ahead then just check out the Toyota Premio and u will understand that why Toyota is the Best Choice of every Class in the World and not the Honda.\n",

            "Well after reading alot of CIVIC vs CORROLLA I decided to write my own review as we keep a corrolla and a civic at all times. I agree with ayubian2 in the sense that one cant compare corrolla with civic the main reasons being:1. corrolla is a multi purpose vehilcle it performs on off-road as well as on metal road but doesnt give extreme performance on neither side. Because of its soft suspension it doesnt offer much control or rather the feeling of being in control on plain roads in high speeds, on rough terrain there is always the problem of road clearence in corrolla as well(lesser than civic tho)2. corrolla is designed to be long lasting with cheap maintenance which is not required for longer periods of time that is the reason many countries prefer corrolla (or camry) to be driven as taxis.3. Civic is not a multi purpose vehicle it is designed for plain roads only doesnt offer much on rough terrain infact its a nightmare! Its stiff suspension makes is perfect for high speeds as it offers alot more control for example if there is a turn and a corrolla would pass that turn on 80km/h and no more, a civic could very well make that turn on speeds as high as 140 to 160 km/h without any anxious feelings.4. Maintenance wise civic requires much more care than a corrolla, and is much more expensive, but the drive is that much more addictive as well.5. as far as feul economy is concerned in EFI engines if the RPM is roughly below 3000 then any EFI car is in economy mode, above that there is no concept of feul economy just performance(true for corrolla as well as civic as well as any other EFI engine).The base line is both civics and corrollas are built for different purposes, the former built for style and (is technologically advanced) metal roads, the later built to last longer with support for multiple terrains.So it could be argued but in my opinion if one has to take real mileage from his/her car that is as high as 200 to 300 km per day on average, corrolla should be the first choice, if one wants a car just for his driving pleasure in style and low mileage in mostly in city drives AND HE/SHE can AFFORD to lose money on resales, civic would be very appropriate for such party.Example1: we took a mileage of 5lacs and 50thousand kilometers from a corrolla(japanese) in just 4 years and sold it without any maintenance at a price that was 5thousand PKRs less than our buying price!Example2: we took a mileage of 40thousand kilometers from a pakistani civic in just 18months with about 50thousandPKRs maintenance INCLUDING TYRES and sold it for fifteen thousand PKRs less than our buying price!But one thing is for sure the driving pleasure that one gets in a civic is far far far more than wut one gets in any corrolla!Do the math :)PS: corrolla is ideal if one doesnt like to drive and employs a driver to drive ;)hope this was insightful for some atleast :)do the math :)\n",

But the new changes regarding suspension has made it more stable on corners and steep turns.On road performance has improved with new AWD. Off road performance was always legendary.Off road capability has been enhanced through more users friendly,single touch controls for diverse terrains.If you compare the interior with the contempararies its not as impressive,but comfortable leg space ist and second row. it has big fuel tank,i get 7km/l+milage.its 5000 maintenace is half to Honda Accord(2.4 liters petrol).Now after 25000 KM down the line the only thing it needs is break adjustment.Very noiseless and pretty powerful response when you need to pump up.Its a real off road with improved on road capabillties.

            "This car is extremely pathetic in built quality. I own a brand new mehran and i never felt driving a brand new car. One would be extremely lucky to buy a new mehran without any manufacturing defects.Pak Suzuki has been making this car for more than two decades and they have never improved it a bit. Rather mehrans from early 90's have better body strength with all rubber and plastic parts were far better before. No improvement at all in brakes, engine technology, seating and drive comforts\n",

            "By the grace of Almighty Allah got my new City delivered week ago and to define the experience in two words....LOVIN IT :) well every one says that about his new ride :D coming to serious part...STYLE: 5/5 ... well nothing is perfect but keeping in mind all the cars available in pakistan City is a class apart in style and i mean it , no matter from which angle you view it u just love the elegance and the sportish look...and city is the only car in pakistan on which every available color suits in a very unique way...interior is also very stylish and while driving u just keep admiring the strong and classy interior / visuals!COMFORT: 4/5 .... its quite comfortable no matter u are at the drivers seat , the front passenger seat , or the back seat u will enjoy the ride alot! one doesnt feel fattigue no matter how long the drive!!!! AC is simply superbo0o0! Even at fan speed 2 it will chill ur **** out n i mean it! and the best thing is that rear passengers get instant kooling due to AC vents in the lower part of back seats! Arm rest adds to the comfort and there are so many places to stuff ur items! i read many views regarding hard suspension...frankly speaking it prooved nothing more than a mith :s Performance : 4/5 .... awesome acceleration , doesnt feel like a family sedan once u try to push it a little too far , u will love the acceleration and the firmness and smootnes in the ride is indeed hard to find in any other paki car ive driven!Value fo money : :-////////// rather 0/5 .... man 1.4 million is way too much for even a civic according to me and am way against car prices in pakistan ..... but yes frankly speaking hell better alue fo money than XLI (no offense) , but with the advent of 1.6 GLI these two cars are no longer comparable as 1.6 GLI is now a different class......anyways all cars are over priced :/ city n rolla should be 9lacs maxFuel economy: just done 200 kms but getting 11.1 km/l and its bound to increase upto 14 km/l as ive noticed in many other pplz sheeti :) hence its goodOverall: .... Best buy in paki car market....i respect corolla and love it too (leaving aside XLI :D coz i expect power in anythng above 1 million) .... but i went for a city cox its cheaper and a bit better than GLI 1.3 in my eyes :) ..... hope this review elps...\n",

I was very much fascinated and liking it. I had to travel to Islamabad, through motorway in Oct. My first long drive on City. After I reached back from Islamabad to Lahore.. the first thing I did was I sold out the City. Reasons were that I was dead tired during the journey and secondly the pick was not that impressive. I bought GLi on the very next day. I had to travel to Peshawar after a month. All the complaints which I had against the City were washed away by the GLi. I like City now.

            "The reason why people in pakistan love civics is certainly not because of its comfort. It is the best u get in terms of the driving exhilaration, cornering, roadgrip at high speeds, braking and so much more. The suspension is hard, no doubt but that is always an easy compromise for those who seek driving excitment. Driver's Seating position is excellent. The dashboard console is very detailed and well arranged. Central Arm rest, cup holders and the storage spaces are well managed by relocating and redesigning the handbrake. seat fabric is outclass and leather interior is also optional. The interior styling just keeps on improving with every new model they introduce. Honda has been the pioneers in introducing new technology in the country and everyone wil certainly agree to that. The cars are hi-tech specially in terms of engines introduced. Even with a SOCH 1.8 we get 140 hps which is 10 more than a 1.8 DOCH 1Z-FE engines offered in Corolla here. Engines are trouble free. i-Vtec engine is very responsive, gives u good economy when driven at low RPM's and proven for their durability. Features like ABS, EBD, dual airbags, sunroof and optional navigation, rear view camera are some of the options that makes it good value for money.\n",

            "OK, so I got the delivery of a brand new Honda City MT last week and below is what I have to say:The drive is very smooth, even when compared to my previous Steermatic (if you discard the difference of transmission, that is). The engine is almost noiseless, the cabin is very secluded too.The steering is very smooth as well.The black interior is a pain. Not only is it super prone to dust, it also makes the car unbearably hot to sit in when under direct sunlight. The interior quality is also below par. I expected better.Compared to the earlier model of City, I don't see any improvement in the cabin room size. Feels the same. The internal sheet between the engine and the cabin is very thin, it seems. The horn sounds to be going off inside the cabin, it's that loud.I have been driving the car for around a week now and so far, the econometer says that I am doing around 14.1 kmpl in the city with 100% AC on. Looks good but I can only confirm if this is accurate once I refill.All in all, I like the car but I feel I deserved better in 1.4 million. Things like rear speakers, alloy rims, better tyres should be standard in this amount.\n",

Stand this car on a highway and let a Daewoo passby, your car will make u feel u have swayed. What is the use of having a bloch under the seats. This car has not to be driven by only ladies. Ergonomics if poor. Fuel consumption in city area is not more than 10. I hav a 2 months old car. Touch the roof and u will feel u are touching thermopore...be careful its very fragile.

It provides both options for transmission system i.e. automatic and manual. With its beautiful “Arrow short form” design and specious interior. In short this car is blend of style and modern features with very reasonable price.It runs smoothly without producing harsh noise and any technical disabilities. This competent engine will have the capability to generate 100 bhp, to provide power to car for rushing through highways in whispering sound.In short COROLLA IS FAR BEHIND THIS BEAUTY.\n",

Whenever u drive on the road, if a honda city comes in front of u just take a good look at the rear of the car and then u will feel disgusted. The car looks like shit from behind. There is no projection of diggi, it looks like a vitz. The rear lights have been tilted which make the car look as if it had an accident from behind. If u view the car from side view u will notice that the diggi is very short and the bounet is comparatively large. The car looks like a wagon. If u see the interior the colour is dark back on the dashboard. Remember the cars back in 1990's which had a black interior which was then changed to beige or gray. So u guys want to move ahead or recede back in the ancient days if u wanna buy this car. Overall the city is absolutely a pathetic car and it is evident from the fact of its slow resale. Why do people dont buy this car if it is a good Car? Why is the Corolla the World's Best Selling Car since the past 15 years. Why is the Corolla the Best Selling Car of the USA today? Ask for your self. People are not stupid. The ones's who go for the city, i think are stupid!\n",

When u drive the Car you will not feel anything like a car but it feels like a very heavy jeep. Unlike the jeep the car has poor ground clearance and the shock absorbers are not good. The car trails from behind after driving 30000 Km and the look of the car is heavily compromised at this mileage as the car shocks settle completely. The car gives an old look after driving 30000 Km or more. The interior cushions are of very poor  quality and look. The car does not respond well to your driving style instead u have to compromise your driving with the car's handling.I have now bought a Toyota Premio X (1.8 vvti) and honestly the drive is much much better than the Civic Reborn. The handling is very smooth and stream lines injection is flet upon pressing the throttle. The acceleration is slightly better than the civic and the interior gives the feel of luxur. Civic's interior on the other hand is not pleasable to the eye. The shape of Premio is also much better than the civic. The civic looks like a wagon from the side view due to its very short bounet and rear trunk. Honda company is made a mess out of civic in trying to make the car futuristic. instead they have ended up in making a car which is a combination of a jeep and wagon. The future cars are'nt suppose to be like this!\n",

            "Honda Civic (Popularly Known as Reborn) is a very sluggish car when you drive it. I had a honda civic oriel prosmatec 2007 which i sold recently. At first i thought that there is no match for this car. Then i bought a Toyota Premio X (1800 cc vvti) 2005 model and all seroiusly speaking the drive is much much better than the civic. The immdeiate difference i noticed was that Premio was very smooth and felt very light. Honda Civic on the other hand felt like i am driving a very heavy vehicle. It didnt felt like a car. over the interior, specially the door cushion of civc are not good. The car after driving 30000 km becomes sluggish. The shock absorbers settle to the ground. The car feels like a speed boat with the rear side slightly down. I anyone really likes to buy a car, it is my advice that buy a Toyota Premio or Altis instead of a civic as Toyota Cars 1800 cc cars have very smooth response of acceleration and handling than the Honda, which otherwise is like driving a car with a trailer behind.\n",

            "People please have some guts to face the truth.... Losers who don,t buy a CITY and have a COROLLA instead (also known as KHOTTA COROLLA, its not your fault obviously you have a Corolla so you will praise that your car is better. I bought a new 1.3 Corolla Gli VVTi in 2009 and then i also bought a City 1.3 i-Vtec in 2010... bought both cars zero meter on booking (so you can't blame me for buying a mis-used 2nd hand car). But  trust me... The feel, comfort driving senstivity, pleasure and overall sense of satisfaction that you get from a CITY, its toooooo far ahead from the stupid COROLLA. I still have both the cars and last year i made the biggest mistake going to Islamabad on the COROLLA. I swear to God midway on the motorway i was too damn tired. I simply hate driving my COROLLA. And just a proof of success for all COROLLA loving losers... Honda doesn't need a lame big car in the 1300 category to stand upto COROLLA... If you think City is smaller than how about this: A SMALLER CAR IS ENOUGH TO MAKE A BIGGER CAR LOSE ITS MARKET SHARE. Oh and by the way, if u're educated enough to read english, please see the brochures and compare the dimensions and size of both cars. Still if you disagree, get a measuring tape and measure it for yourself... SUMMARY: CITY is an EXTREMELY AWESOME CAR, keep it up HONDA\n",

Keeping in view the performance, comfort and advance features, this car is much much better than its competitors like Suzuki Cultus (I have also this car) etc. However, I think this car is in the hands of wrong importers and local providers. The main problem with this car is the in-competency of the proper mechanics and their dishonesty to put wrong spare parts. I discussed with importers/providers many times to rectify the problems but feel that probably they dont want to promote it. If these problems are rectified. Chev Joy can compete Toyota vitz in coming years as it has same power, strong body and good  shape but it is more comfortable and economical than even Toyota Vitz.I could not understand why Chev Joy or Spary promoters dont want to promote it more.

            "I have owned the Alto VXR 2005 for the last six years. Soon after buying it i had the tyres renewed to dunlop. changed the upholstry, installed central locking and power windows, changed the music system. Since then i have been using the car for all of my driving needs including 5 round road trips from karachi to lahore and islamabad. having driven it for 80,000 km in six years still it sounds and runs like new. Points to consider are routine maintenance like changing the oil for sump and gear. cleaning of radiator vanes and ac filters. AC service every year. battery renewal every two years. tappet adjustment every 3000 km. stuff like that. The road grip is excellent at very high speeds, the turning radius is marvellous and the comfort level is pleasent for a hatchback. I would suggest alto for every person who wants value for money.\n",

Leg space in front is not enough, as it is pointless to have projection under seats. 175 tyres is useless, the car skids. What a blunder, no rear door speakers, its a saving not more than Rs 1500.

            "I Partially agree with most of the users that corolla is nodoubt a very good car, but we have to understand there are some flaws in this car that need to be adressedCONS1. it has a crappy fuel average 13kpl 0r max 14 kpl on highway, where as city can give upto 20kpl or over if u keep ur foot light.i dont understand why corolla makes so much fuss about vvti and z gen engines when they only deliver average fuel economy2. the most annoying thing is that when ever u put an altis against a civic or a gli against city, in a drag race or top speed comparison, the toyota always loses and by margin too3. compared to what they are making in japan, toyota is giving far less superior car in quality in Pakistan4. and something which cannot be ignored pay 1.4 M rupees for an xli and u get no abs, manual windows and no airbags, A gocart gives better facilities than thatPLUSPOINTS1. excellent value for money in terms of resale 2. very reliable engine and suspension, though engine has average fuel eco3. spare parts easily available and at good prices\n",

            "In this day and age, Toyota are producing manual-winding windows! I had an altercation with Toyota Rawal Motors (in Rawalpindi, Pakistan) on 2 issues:1. Why are Toyota producing 9 separate models on the same mold? (He said they were all Corolla - from 1.3 XLI to 2.0 DG! He couldn't justify why so many different cars had the same scaffolding & the same name. And if that excuse is for a moment accepted, he couldn't answer why the public was not being transferred the economical benefit of this trickery)2. Why on earth in the 21st century was a million-rupee car not offering motorised windows & ABS?Fuel economy: my Honda City does 24 kmpl @ 80 kmph without airconditioning on the motorway.

What I like about the car is its shape and fuel economy.mine did nearly 14 - 15KM per liter of petrol which is  pretty fair usage.What I did not like about the car was that its body is not as strong and reliable as the previous models.Toyota Pakistan seems to have compromised on quality of the body of this car, also in my case the car had Spart problem soon after purchase, there was a weird noise apparently from the rear left side. despite having gone several times to their repair centres there was no use, .. they could not even fix it.. it was basically bad quality control that resulted in this ...I would personally not recommend anyone buy this car ..\n",

            "Posted by Ahmed on Mar 25, 2011\n",
            "When I bought the new Swift in August 2010, I was disappointed with its fuel consumption. First 5-10 tanks just disappeared.It would simply refuse to give me anything more than 220-250 Km in a tank. [5-6Km/L] It was a horrific experience. At 1000Km mark, got the tuning done. The average was still the same .. horrible!But without doing anything, the average kept improving. By the time it had done 4000Km, I was getting 430-440 Km in a tank in the city. And every time on refueling it takes 39 liters to fill up the tank. Means when I refuel, there is always 4 liters of petrol still in the tank. So basically I am getting 430-440Km in 39 liters within city. That’s pretty neat.Suzuki recommended that it doesn't need an oil change till it has done 5000Km. And since this car is very sparingly used, it took 7 months until it was ready for its OIL/FILTER change. So they changed the oil (ZIC) and oil filter and said everything else is fine.Luckily I had to go to Islamabad so I decided to take this little monster on the highway to see how it performs in terms of fuel consumption. Filled it up, again as usual 39L.We took the motorway. Tried to keep the RPM at or below 3. With the Swift, it’s easily possible to drive at 100-110Km/h with the RPM comfortably below 3. Since it’s gotten pretty hot for the road, used the A/C throughout. To my surprise, we reached Islamabad, attended a wedding in Pindi, went back to Islamabad and next morning came back to Lahore via GT Road. All in ONE tank only. It was simply unbelievable. Back to back, we drove 728 kilometers with A/C in a single tank. And yes, when I refueled again at home it did take 39L only … which is funny. :o)VERDICT: Fuel Consumption AverageCity = 11.15 Km/LHighway = 18.66 Km/L\n",

            "I have had purchased an Alto CNG VXR in August 2005. Changed the Rims to 13\" with new Tyres. Even then it had the worst braking and road grip. Slightly better than Mehran in comfort, but NOT value for money. Two of people I know, having Alto, faced accidents, pretty bad, due to braking and road grip. Fuel economy is Good. It consumes slightly more than Mehran, still very good for a 970 cc engine. Engine is old and gets very noisy when u drive it for more than 25000 km. Parts are also very expensive, you can ask your dealer about it, as compared to Mehran. I DONT SUGGEST BUYING IT.\n",

            "I own a 2010 Nissan Sunny 1.6L M/T for just over a year now & has found it to be a beautiful driving experience. This car is superb on the road, giving u a comfortable driving pleasure that is near difficult to find among locally manufactured vehicles. With 1600cc TwinCam 4valve engine, it performs much better than any of its competition. Also, it is the best available car in its price range with Toyota Altis, Honda Civic & Chevrolet Optra costing approx. 2 or 3 hundred thousand extra whereas Honda City, Toyota Corolla Gli & Xli, Mitsubishi Lancer are underpowered.Only negative aspect of the car comes at the point of selling and that too due to bad or no proper marketing of the Nissan Brand by the Gandhara-Nissan Motors. But, with this cars' overall performance package, it gives you your money's worth to the dime.\n",

            "Bought a GLi back in September 2009, and my humble advise to anyone reading this and interested in a 1.3 Corolla is that DO NOT WASTE MORE THAN A MILLION RUPEES ON XLi..Coming back to the GLi, its a good car over all.. i was very surprised by the excellent fuel economy on petrol.. especially without the AC in winters, one tank is more than enough for a long time.. The only thing i dont like about the GLi is the fact that its underpowered. with a body size this big and having just a small engine of 1300cc is an issue.. then again to some people it may not be an issue but to me it is..this is why i have decided to sell off my GLi and get myself the Altis.. Otherwise, the new corolla is worth your money (but not the XLi !!)..Regards\n",

Despite being a very rich country, they are delivering this car in their country with very smart engine, its average on petrol is 4.2 L / 100km. And in Pakistan they are delivering it with 80's potohar carburetor engine with average 6 L /100 km on petrol. In city it becomes worse as 10L/100km. Thats why Japanese manufacturers never mention fuel consumption in their specs. However, we are thankful to them at-least they are providing us cars that run on our bumpy roads for years. This car would be my first choice to buy if provided with Suzuki's latest K6A 660cc engine. So that I can happily drive it on petrol in CNG shortage periods.

The sound of little stones hitting the car during driving is echoed inside the cabin which is very much irritating. i can literally hear the sound of splashes of gasoline in the fuel tank inside the cabin.Overall i am satisfied with my car as no thing in this world i perfect.\n",

For instance, less legs space for the back seater,  no air bags, only 1.3version available, only four doors version available, no sunroof available,  most basic dash-board,  no bluetooth, etc etc. etc.....The fuel economy is not satisfactory and should do better. Besides the car is not areo-dynamically designed and is one of the reasons why it is not a fuel efficient car. My suggestion is that identical Swift models be introduced in Pakistan including the 1.6 sports version.\n",

            "This is a review of Toyota Altis 1.8l Cruisetronic SR that I own for the past 4 months. Coming from a Honda background, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the solid feel of the car, its dampened suspension, ride comfort, acceleration and engine power (I took it to Pir Sohawa without any issues whatsoever), the ability to manually shift gears when in the mood, cruise control option on highway etc. Also NOTE that it would have a better RESALE value than Honda in Pakistani market.What I didn't like was the absence of fifth gear due to which I noticed that the rpm reached 3,000 around 120 kmph. I think with the fifth gear the fuel economy in long distance would get better. Anyways, I have a detailed analysis of its fuel consumption here if you want to see: http://www.pakwheels.com/forums/member-opinions-suggestions/144670-fuel-mileage-toyata-altis-cruisetronic-2010-aI believe the car gives much better fuel mileage than Honda Civic VTI Oriel Prosmatic in city or on long distance. I also wish the car had dual airbags (the passenger side is missing). Anyways, I would highly recommend the car to anyone interested in buying it.\n",

            "IN MY REVIEW, I will Discuss about toyota corolla XLI and ITS RESALE.We all Think that toyota corolla XLI is Much more expensive than it is. This is not the reason at all. We all know that this car has much better resale value than any other SEDANS e.g CITY, CIVIC etc. It is for some reason that it is expensive than CITY. Although this car doesn't offer Power Windows, ABS etc...... but this car is much attractive due to its resale value. The question here arises that Why has SUZUKI Mehran THE MOST RESALE VALUE among all cars of Pakistan. The reason that it is A much affordable car with CHEAP MAINTENANCE. As the price of this cars in 2011 has been increased, Its resale value has gone at a very low rate. But we can see many 2008-2009 MEHRANS IN THE ROADS.NOW I SHALL COME TO THE TOPIC. HONDA CITY IS A much smaller car than XLI and IT HAS ONLY FRONT DISC BRAKES WHILE XLI OFFERS 4 WHEEL DISC BRAKES ALTHOUGH IT DOESN'T OFFER ABS.The SHAPE OF COROLLA IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AS THE FRONT AND THE SIDES ARE  MADE JUST SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM CAMRY.THE LAST THING IS THE DRIVE AND MAINTENANCE. THe Drive OF BOTH ARE ALMOST EQUAL and the maintenance of corolla is far much cheap than CITY.IF I HAD TO SELECT BETWEEN THESE TWO, I WOULD DEFINITELY GO WITH COROLLA  BCZ COROLLA ROKZZZZZ!\n",

If you are looking for a car that has all the power  features and easy to maintain, this is the car to get.

            "A year ago, when i left my bank job, i had to retrun the bank provided corolla (GLi 2008 model) back to the bank. At that time i was not much aware about the prices of used car but i was shocked to learn that a used 1000cc car like cultus and vitz is selling at a price range of 700k to 1100k. While all the bigger cars were kind of out of my budget and affordibility. Still I wanted a bigger car and classy car and optra 2005 got all one expects in a car of class. It comes with full option that even reborn or all new corolla failed to offer till now and that too at a price of a cultus. I have been a proud owner of the car now for more than a year and love to drive the car, especially on motorway where the beast like engine of the car gets a chance to flex its muscles. The airconditioning is supberb and the climate control keeps the inside of the car comfortable, while the cool box keeps the water, drinks and chocolates cool during the long journeys. The driving seat has the legs and lumber support keeping the long drives pleasureable and tireless. The spares of the car are easily available in Lahore from Montgomery Road and Chevy Platinum Motors at a very reasonable price (parts are cheaper than vitz and new swift). A good well maintained used optra is available at a price range of 850K to 950k, which according to me is the best value for money. The only problem with the car is that there are no service centers or spare parts availability in smaller cities. I strongly recommend the car to people who want to drive bigger car at a price of a cultus.\n",

            "I ve had my ride for about 8 months now. i shifted from a Cuore, so i had a genuine learning experince first few months.All in all, City is an excellent car. Body&interior:It is shaped beautifully, and the interior is awesome as well. In fact, the car is very roomy when you sit inside. The Dashboard is highquality and well laid out with dual glove compartments adding to the benifit.The seats are comfortable (atleast to me) and the car has ample bootspace (even with CNG). Engine/Mechanics:The car is very smooth and feels powerful enough in city driving (never drove on a highway yet). The best part about this car is its milage rate and the Air Conditoner. The car is a dream to drive, both on CNG and Petrol, and summers are enjoyable with the level of cooling it provides. The braking and accelration is good as wellAll in All, it is a goood car for city driving by a small family.The cons, that i have felt are below: (in my humble opinion. please dont start a honda vs toyota fight)1) The engine bay is a bit cramped and low on space. especially if you get CNG installed, you ll have a bit of trouble in changing the light bulbs.2) being a honda, i dont really like its suspension. It is superb, but only as long as you drive on good paved roads. It deteriotes faster than a corolla if driven on rough roads. Plus, its suspension works are costlier to maintain.3) The Lights, in my car, its always one bulb or the other that is going out in teh headlights. i have 3 mates with the same car and we all have a residen tproblem with our headlights.4) again, in all 3 cars of this model that i have driven, i have come to not trust the fuel gauge. even 500 rs worth of petrol sends its needle  soaring  to the middle. i just think its a bit un reliable.5) the side frame f windscreen deals a serious blow to visibility, especially whole turning on junctions (but you get used to it)all in all, it is a good car. but i would rather go for a corolla if given the option now, solely because of the suspension as i drive on rought roads a bot.Hope this helps.\n",

At petrol a 1.3 efi car will consume less than mehran, This car has no safety and a real teen Daaba. this car has no comfort inside, seat are very hard, shock and suspension is very hard, rear suspension uses leaf spring which is only used in trucks other than this car now a days. it has no defogger, rpm meter, trip meter, remote fuel lid or back door open button,fog lamps, center console, cup holders. it creates severe starting problems in winter on gas and even many times on petrol. it has no road grip. brakes are the way very very pathetic and poor. inner space is very conjusted especially in front of driver, driver seems to be trapped between the seat and steering and windscreen, driving position is very bad, gears are the way too hard. alternator is poor, if you switch on lights, AC blower  horn will fade out. in factory fitted CNG version paksuzuki fit Rickshaw CNG kit which never speed up the car beyond 110 Km/hr. in short i want to kill all paksuzuki owners and share holder for making such a car at so high price.\n",

Fuel economy is 5-star, changing gears in proper ratio and keep drive on 3200 rpm OR 105 km/h. Its performance and drive pleasure increases as speed increases but also consumption increases little. On highway with A/C consumption is16-17 km/litre.\n",

            "I bought my chevrolet exclusive in 2005. Its the imported version with 800 cc engine.To start with it is the best compact car around by a huge margin. Vitz comes in a different category and with a different price so cannot compare Vitz. Vitz is a better car than Chevrolet Joy or exclusive in my opinion.Coming back to the car.In last 5 years the only part that was replaced was reverse switch. Reverse light stopped working. Other than that the car is absolutely trouble free Mashallah.Never been to mechanic, no unusual sounds, no cheap quality material used. I love its fuel economy. It gives me between 18-21 km / liter on long routes and within city it gives an average of 13-14 km / liter. All this with ac and without extra effort to keep the fuel expense down by using a light foot etc. I don't have cng in it but I have seen trouble free exclusive / joy with cng. But who needs a cng when the avg is so damn good.Its a safe car as compared to its competitors. It has the usual seat belts, plus it has collapsable  steering wheel in case of impact with the steering during accident. The side doors have bars to give added protection in case of an impact. It lacks ABS and airbags which is a disadvantage.Front seats are pretty comfortable and a person of my height 6ft can easily and freely move around inside the car. Even the passengers at the back are seated comfortably something which is missing in santro, mehran and even swift.The car is not built for performance but for its 800cc engine its pretty fast and if driven within limits it has good road grip. The height of the car is not great which in turns hits speed breakers or car breakers in our case, but height is kept low intentionally to keep a good road grip. Overall I can say that it can easily beat any car in its category with performance on stock engine.Its a shame that the car couldn't make a place in the market and its discontinued now and a newer model is launched which is SPARK. Currently spark is imported and with high duties its not value for money in my humble opinion.You can find a decent chevrolet joy in around 400k which is good value for money and overall I feel that its a car to keep. I believe my car can run trouble free for another 5 years or so.\n",

It was built to be basic and cheap and it sure is basic, but cheap…I don’t think so.Even the engineers at the Daihatsu dealership admit that this car has some design faults which can’t be fixed especially some clutch related issues. Apart from that it is very reliable and easy to maintain and it’s always welcome in the second hand car market.Very economical too just about runs on the smell of petrol ; an despite what you might read in other reviews; it is quite a nippy thing; for instance if you compared it with other brands 1.0 litre cars ; this one is ......it can hold it's own on open roads and overtakes ok too as long as you plan ahead and give it enough revs; it's quite willing and nips up to 70mph quite smartly. and will hold this speed quite happily on the motorway. The engine is quite up to this sort of behaviour and very willing to rev through the range; and indeed one thing that did surprise me was the flexibility of the engine; which will pull ; as long as you aren't in a hurry ;\n",

Power steering is as smooth as butter. Power windows and power mirrors further add to the list of things that would attract potential customers. After market CD player and that is all you need.   The engine is German and performs rather well on petrol. On CNG the performance is not effected BUT the life of the engine get reduced dramatically. The engine bay is too cramped up for local mechanics and only those with strong nerves or those with no brains get themselves involved with a Chery. Parts are available but only of you know where to look. But still its a daunting task. The ride is smooth but will become some what unstable on higher speeds and bumpy roads. All in all a good car for use within city and a no no for inter city. The accelerator position will take its toll on your ankle but the seats are comfortable and so is the leg room.\n",

            "Posted by hamza on Jan 24, 2011\n",
            "Hi,I have purchased a zero meter Alto in September 2010 and it was my very new experience as my all family members has CULTUS and we have had a pretty good experience of Cultus over all.Untill than I drove 11,000 KMs on ALTO, it gave me excellent CNG consumption even on AC, with around 210 kms in one cylinder of CNG, my experience is its over all good family car which you can rely. I installed Dunlop tires and its grip is good enough now, car's MP 3 player is good but have only two speakers in the front which is not enough for the good sound, I found two major cons in the car.1. The gears are very tough to shift at the start, even after I changed the gear oil on first 1,000 km, still they are not hard.2. Car's engine noise, its more than what I was expecting, but I would like to tell you the reason that it is because of the POTOHAR's engine that ALTO has replaced with his new body, but with more noise, I also felt that car's engine is more stronger than cultus's previous 3 cylinder engine mainly if you compare it when you drove it on mountains.Over all, it was a very good experience, AC is chilling and it does not go to heated up if you regularly (Once in a week) check the radiator water and do not fill the bottle up to the mark that is MAX, try to use coolent instead of water in the radiator, my opinion is that car is expensive and we can get a cultus in that cost but on the other hand, you can see the over all cost of 1000cc or even 850cc cuore's cost has increased so much so purchasing ALTO is just to complete the need of a new car which you can easily rely on, and my findings are that when my car will start giving out work after 2 or 3 years, I will sale it out :)Good part of ALTO is excellent consumption after I adjusted tappets on completion of 1000 kms, comfort and its cuts and shapes.Other than that, one should not expect to get a Honda city's performance in that price which is already very high.\n",

            "1. Price - though higher than many \"equivalent\" cars Honda has more value for money.2. Value for Money - in 2005 I had compared Innova with Honda City. Even though the base models were priced near to each other, I realised that the money for Innova was going into making the size larger while the same money for Honda's smaller size (compared to Innova) was going into quality. That is the image Honda enjoys and not without justification. [Though the quality is still something that leaves more to desire as it is not 100% perfect.  But then which car is?? At least I can say they are improving on quality every time a new model is launched. The IVTEC engine now is something!! Earlier GXI =non ZX version had suspension problems and a weak eletronic power Steering that reqd changing every 30,000 kms or so if you drive on rough roads. I hope they have improved these now.]3. Fuel consumption - the best in this size and class of vehicle I guess. The new car gives you a 14.7 in Lahore driving if you know how to let go of the accelerator without letting the speed go down at the same time. With this trick you can even get this mileage at 100 kmph too, but naturally at this speed you need to have an open road to drive for some time and not reduce the speed too soon. 4. Somewhat more Features - compared to other cars of same price or slightly higher. eg Altis has 4-speed automatic while Honda City has 5-speed for eg. Of course earlier Honda did not come with ABS and Air bags as standards while lower cost cars provided the same. Even today Maruti A- Star provides these I am told. The new Honda City of 2009 which is still selling in 2010 has the new features and more like KMPL meter and so on.5. Aesthetics/ Beauty-- The arrow shot form is indeed a hit and so are the interiors.\n",

It is not as spacious as Civic or Corolla (for 4 person its fine) but when you sit in it you can feel luxury and solidness around with stylish interior.

            "Its been over 3 months now that I have owned this car and so far my experience with it is just remarkable. I have given 5/5 to almost all of its ratings. This wasn't out of excitement. Actually I can explain that one by one.Style:The venom looks of the car and the sporty look make it look MUCH better than at least: Honda Civic, Old Shape city (duh!), Old Shape Corolla, Toyota Vitz and all cars manufactured and sold by Suzuki. It looks almost equal, if not better than the new corolla.So clearly there is no reason why we cannot give it a 5/5 for style. Comfort: This is pretty much the same for all the new cars in this price range. In my personal experience, its more comfortable than its revival corolla (1.3L).Performance:It goes from zero to hundred in way under 10 seconds. And comes from 100 to zero ALSO in less than 10 seconds. With the only car that offers ABS in this price range, its much safer and gives the driver a peace of mind (that his car is equipped with ABS). The i-vtec is definitely a powerful engine. It went from 100 - 190 in just about 100 seconds. Value for Money:When I was buying this car, its price was around 1.25 Million. However, the only other option that I had was a Toyota Corolla. Corolla's price at that time was 1.29 million. This was the price of a car that DID NOT offer ABS or Power Windows (and was available in two colors only). The model that did offer these features was expensive by about 1.5 lack rupees. Honda City produces 100 horse power, Corolla 1.3L on the other side (inspite of being expensive) produced 85 horse power (though Corolla eats more fuel, which is discussed below). This really is a good value for money because you get more than what you pay for.Fuel Economy:I have not had experience of Honda City or Toyota Corolla in CNG. However, my limited study of Corolla's average on highways in Petrol turned out to be a little over 16 Kilometers per liter. My very own Honda City gave me 22.8 Kilometers per liter on a trip from Islamabad to Peshawar. This fuel average included a distance traveled within the city (about 30 kilometers). The i-vtec is a very fuel efficient engine. It produces more power compared to a vvti and consume's less fuel.One reason why some people preferred Toyota Corolla was spaciousness. That is also very apparent and not particle. The passenger capacity for both cars is 5. However, Honda City's trunk is the most spacious one among all the cars of Pakistan. Any one who sees both the trunks together can easily see the massive difference of space. Its very tangible. The reason is that Honda's Fuel tank is below the front seats and so the rear trunk becomes deeper than the trunks of other cars.In every aspect, I find this car very good value for money, very fuel efficient and comfortable. Definitely something you wouldn't regret.\n",

I din't know about it except that it had better shape than Mehran and also more compact than Mehran. I learnt driving on Fx & Mehran. Mehran was better in driving than FX. But when i bought Cuore and drove it, Really i enjoyed it's drive. That's the point where Cuore beats Mehran and Alto. Despite being 847 cc, it performs like 1000 cc cars. Many times i've experienced racing with Altos and even Cultuses in the city and on motorways and many times i beat those 1000 cc cars.It's pick is awesome, probably best in 0.8 L category. It's performance is best on CNG as compared to other cars and there is a little difference in speed on both CNG and Petrol.It's interior is nice as compared to mehran and i really love it's dashboard. It looks small from outside but when someone sits inside, it looks roomier. It's build quality is better than Mehran and Alto. I would dare to say that it's more fuel efficient than Mehran. I've recorded it's average on motorway at constant speed of 90-100 km/hr both on CNG and Petrol. On CNG it's average is  33 km/kg and on petrol it gave me 22-23 km/litre. It's maintenance is not at all expensive. You wouldn't have the trouble to go to the mechanics very often. It's body is stronger than Mehran.  comfortable than mehran and performs much better than mehran. Only Negative points are it's a bit overpriced, Parts are expensive and resale not as good as that of Mehran.\n",

            "I bought a 2001 model second-hand in 2007. It had been driven on petrol till then. Coure is by far the best of small local cars, i-e it is the best of mehran, alto (and quite possibly cultus) in drive experience, steering softness and spaciousness. Its steering is very soft for a non-power steering, and hence one can call coure semi-power-steering.The 2001 model that i had 1- consumes a lot of petrol, in fact more than honda civic 1998. So I installed CNG, and on CNG itis fine. 2- Its front two tyres get suck with the wheel, so i always had to use hammer or a brick to get them out when punctured.I don't know if coure fixed these issues in the latest reviews, perhaps someone from the PakWheels community let me know about this.\n",

            "Imported vehicles like vits and IST in a stylish hatch back category had set the market trend but buying such cars were risky in terms of no After Sales Back up and warranty.I decided to buy SWIFT because of its Sporty Style and powerfull performance with 1.3L engine.It may be a question mark to think hatch back in 1300cc that is for the first time in Pakistan. However the fuel milage of this car has really impressed me by giving 12~13 km/litre in city while on highway it gives me over 15 km/litre.Price of Swift seems bit higher but if you campare with other 1300cc car like city and corolla, you will find more valueable features like Electric Power Steering, Power windows/ side mirrors, ABS, Immobilizer, Fog lamps, Alloy Wheels, matching side mirrors and handles and 4door speakers sound system makes me feel cool every time i ride it.SWIFTcan be compared with imported Toyota IST but Swift has an edge of 2 years/ 50000 km warranty.  As far as its luggage capacity is concerned its tumble folding seat option gives my enough space  to move luggage easily. I would surely recommend to those who aspire for energy, style and a sporty driving experience.\n",

Lets take some positives.The car is good attempt in automotive design.The aerodynamics of Daewoo Matiz (Chevy Matiz), A small engine,  Cute looks...similar to Mehran (Not to mistaken by alto)...  Cute Looks.... Learner Drivers machine.. The car is tiny, but can accomodate..which is why its been marketed under the camouflagd name...  Cherry QQ Comfortable....  Certainly not for a long haul with your family...unless you  like aching knees, and overheated toes.  Specially made uncomfortable, when our usual folks are smoking their hearts out.I would not be so critical of the car though, had the price been placed correctly.  This is why the Pakistani cars are never \"Loved\", and people perfer buying reconditioned Japanese builds rather than paying a fortune for cheap Tin and Plastic.In general, I feel as people are becoming moreaware of their rights, they are also expecting value for their hard earned cash.  So, what will make me buy this car ??  better seats, ABS, a better braking system, CD player, Child Lock and a nicer ECM.\n",

            "Dear reader,                       I know you must be hearing from many people about how bad this car is. Well, since I have myself driven a lot many cars and have tested them to the fullest extend possible, I have a little to say about this master car.      The Suzuki Liana is first of all is not preferred because it is a fully electronic car. Ordinary mechanics can not handle the likes of such cars. Mechanics who don't even know what Torque means. The car has to be given to an authorized Suzuki workshop in order to be repaired.      The Liana is also not favored due to it poor acceleration on CNG. This only happens when you use AC while driving it on CNG. The car's Micro processor cuts down the power from the engine to sustain economy and therefore it lacks acceleration.       Why would I want to buy the Liana? Well, it is a complete car for it's price. It lacks a strong body and a good torque but here are the following points:1. Suzuki Liana offers ABS and traction control at a very affordable price of 13 lakh.2. It is spacious more than the Corolla or City.3. The car is extremely resistant to over-heating even though it is a Suzuki.4. It has a very stable Rpm system. The car reacts quickly to overall clutch use and gear shifting.5. The brakes, although being drums at rear, are better than Corolla or Civic. The weight of the car allows it's break down force to stay on track and avoid skidding.6. The Liana is faster than the Corolla or city and accelerates better on higher gears only on fuel.7. The car's overall handling is better than the Civic! The traction control is so stable that even the Honda civic is no match for it's handling.Why won't you buy the Liana?1. The car depreciates it's value even after a month use by 1 lakh.2. The car is only meant for soft handling unlike the Corolla. It can give you a lot of trouble and may need repairs if not handled with care.3. The aerodynamics of the car are horrible for corner taking. The car losses it speed while taking a corner.\n",

            "I am driving this corolla Xli 2010 for the last one week and also drove city 2010 manual. corolla is bigger car , more aggressive looking than city. its distinctive look is because of Camry adaption of design and its excellent value for money. When you drive you will have smile on your face because it gives you the satisfaction that whatever you spend on this car is not going to be wasted.  The number of corolla sale is highest in Pakistan even surpassing Suzuki mehran, cultus. and latest figure showed Gli having major chunk of 3500 monthly sales for the last 9 months straight. till after a year of introduction the resale value is so good that those who bought it for Rs. 11,99,000 can easily sale this for Rs. 12,50,000. The maintenance is still cheap as with previous generation corolla as you can buy air oil filters of Pakistan made or Thailand made at very cheap price. It has V Vti engine which gives you power as and when wanted or you can drive normally to have in city  10.50 km per liter mileage.  Its accelerator is so responsive that you need to get adjusted in first few days. This was the problem in US Corolla and Camry but here as the floor carpet was different in which it stuck there. The ride is not as hard as of the previous model. its spacious and it has power to get 5 adults or a family with reasonable mileage. Now comparison of Xli with City as both fall in same price and engine capacity. Honda City has very good comfortable ride with low engine noise. It has better fuel efficiency and can give you 11 plus km/ltr easily. Its only draw back is its acceleration which is normal and not as good as corolla. As city wants its car to be more fuel efficient rather than use for car racing. In Thailand you can change the car's rpm and throttle by using the laptop with an experience after market engineer. The city seems to be smaller from back. Its resale is very bad and its Rs. 100,000 down already if you try to resale it even after few months.The price difference is only Rs. 39,000. And even now dealers offering Rs. 35,000 discount on it.  its interior is black which majority people dont like it . The indian and thailand version with V class is the beige interior. The toyota corolla is now having much more improved quality and now giving the city a tough time which is known for quality and comfort.\n",

            "\"If you don't have any worries, buy Mehran\" is 100% true for this car. This car, no doubt, have been the most successful one in the Pakistani market, and the reason behind this is not the superb quality but the cheaper price which fools nearly everyone. I have had this car for a while now and i am not happy with its performance. having not many points but still i would to elicit some Pros and Cons of this car.<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>:1. Cheaper, infect the cheapest 0.8L car in the world.2. Low maintenance cost.3. Good fuel economy in city so it is quite affordable.4. Spare parts are cheap and easily available.<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>1. Very low quality body2. low quality paint3. very hard suspension, causes back ache, 4. headache and makes your car rattle.5.very noisy engine6. lousy brakes but this problem can be overridden by the selection of 165/70/R12 tires.7. car runs OK till 30K KM, after that it becomes a nightmare to drive.8. Parts are not reliable and wear out quicker than you think.I recommend not to buy this car unless you are low on budget.\n",

When I was looking for a car in this range many of my friends advised me to by a Mehran instead of Coure but Thanks to Allah Almighty I didn't! If compare it to Mehran( well I feel there is no Compare) there are certain points to considerwhich are as under1- Coure's exterior is round cornered which looks more smart & aerodynamic than the box like exterior of Mehran.2- Coure's exterior paint job is far more better than Mehran cuz I peronally see paint drip lines on brand new Mehrans but no such issue for Coure.3- Chasis wise Coure is more strong as it has a rectunglar Chasis while Mehran has straight Chasis u could see many mehran's front wheels somewhat bending out of the Wheel houe as they were under some heavy weight , this is due to weak chasis.4-Coure's interior is more comfortable & good looking while Mehran has inferior quality interior.5- Coure's A/c is more powerful than Mehran's.6- Under the hood coure 50 more CCs than Mehran thats why it has good pick & climbing power as compare to Mehran, moreover its engine is more responsive even on CNG.If u consider the price than I mus t say that the Coure is getting overly priced & the Toyota Company never give any good reason for that, but I still love to have Coure its really fun to drive specially in crowded cities like ours,its also OK on long drives though not very comfortable as they r not designed for long drives.

Interior is well designed, best usage of space you will find places to keep you wallet, mobile, coffee cup, water bottle, loose papers, tissue box and all in reach of hand.Comfort while driving is great for this size car. Spacious in front -- real comfortable.Back seats are relaxing with ample leg space. Drive from Lahore to Peshawar on motorway was not tiring.A/C is perfect for 800cc car, even better than 1000cc (comparing to Cultus).Its MTect-II 800cc engine by no means an 800cc engine, you can easily compare the performance with a 1000cc engine.Exteror, body shape/strength all are good for this scale car. Fuel consumption is approx 12km/litre in city and 15km/liter on motorway. The claim was 18km/litre. So it failed here. But still worth it. At 140km/h it is stable drive. The pick and speed is not that much effected by running A/C.Above all it is with 2 yrs warranty or 50,000km which ever comes first. The knob to adjust fan speed had few problems after 1 month or purchase ... it was a connection solding issue, which i got fixed from a 3S dealer in no time. Staff was trained.Do not go for Chevorlet Joy --- Spark is much better than that.I will say best value for money, I am happy to pay Rs. 40,000 extra for this comparing to Cuore. I am a satisfied driver of Spark --- Alhamdu Lillah.\n",

            "Posted by Zain ul Hassan Khan on Jun 18, 2009\n",
            "Got a New Altis 2005 Automatic. The first good thing is the delivery time .The car is delivered in 19 days after the booking. The General time of booking is around 6 Months for XLI at that time. The interior features are much better than the normal corolla like the Map Lamps for driver and front pessanger. Driver AirBag, Doble Din Pioneer Pre with MP3 Support and very handsome looking Optitron meter. The build quality of interior is below average. The AirVents are not properly fitted. Went to dealership to get it fixed but they could not help although it was a manufacturing fault but they failed to take the responsibility or provide any remedy. The wooden console center pocket is very poorly designed and got broken within first 3 months. Need to get it repaired from a local grill maker who has added the steel rods and since then its working perfectly. The Best thing about Altis is its acceleration. The engine is 133HP i.e 100 kW. 2009 and onwards are detuned to 97KW.Just press the floor and you will feel the torque. Excellent response at low revs. There is no locally manufactured car that can give you such a response upto 3000 RPM which is usually the limit for city driving. Mine is an Automatic so not as fast as the Manual one but still pretty quick. Also the ECT Power mode allows you to keep the lower gears for much longer times. Although if u are flooring the car then ECT or no ECT are same.Doing 150-160 KM/h is pretty easy for the car. The average on fuel is around 10.5 and on CNG with Lambda Kits its 120+ in 55 Liter cylinder.  The General tires that come with the car are no good.However the car does not have scary feeling of bad breaks due to the presence of ABS. I have changed my tires to 205/65/14 and the grips improved a lot. On a rainy day you need to be careful as the ABS engages a lot but for a normal dry day I will rate the brakes above average.The ride is bumpy compared to Japanese Corolla or the Civic But the suspension is blessing in the rural areas with no roads.You need not to care about the bad patches much. The leg room is good for passengers up to 6 feet.Also the rear passengers does not have a same crippling feel that is associated with civic 2008.Looks wise the car is not bad. The door garnish and the side skirts on the doors gives an impressive look to the car they are not sporty but decent. The fog lights are also included as a standard accessory and the switch is part of the indicator stick.Also the car is equipped with a CAT to provide cleaner emissions. Its a shame that the car comes without alloys.It was top of the line model but comes with steel rims.  Overall its a good purchase if you keep in mind the availability of spare parts.\n",

I don't know why people always compare the luxry of Mercedez/BMW or any other good car like Honda with the maintenance cost of Suzuki Mehran. Then it was the best mileage car on petrol as well as CNG. If you want to modify and enjoy sporty car then this is the best car to choose for.

            "Plus:1. Spacious, for a 800cc car. I've drove the Suzuki 800 before, and this QQ is really big in space. Once I was comfortable in the front, I went to the back, and my knees are not even rubbing the front seat back (I'm 1.78m). There are room to tuck in my feet too. 2. Power is so-so, but with the car weighing less than 0.9 ton, pickup is relatively brisk. Wouldn't say much about going fast on long distances, but for everyday cut-and-thrust traffic, it's pretty adequate. Those who say 800cc CMI probably didn't and wouldn't drive anything less than a litre. 3. Economy. Can't really verify but based on its capacity and its weight, I can safely say I can return smelly-smelly 20km/L! 4. Split rear bench. Can't all cars come with this? It really helps in increasing the versatility of an already small car. Maybe Kia can learn something from QQ and change theirs to 60:40 splits. Minus: 1. The car is flimsy. Yes, flimsy. When you open the doors wide (you'll realise the QQ doors doesn't open as wide as you would want it), you'll see the hinge on the body starting to flex. Not a very safe sign here. Engine bay also presented its shoddy works, with just an L-shaped piece of metal holding on to the reservoir intake. All in, just one word - Flimsy. And provided you don't knock into anything, the car might not last a full 10 years out in the tarmac jungle. 2. Spongy seats. It reminds you of those cheap and thin 4\" tilam. You feel every poke if someone sitting behind is pushing his/her knee into the front seat backs. It reminds you also of Osim massage chairs, only it's just plain irritating. 3. Sticky gears. The auto will come next year (as I was told), and the manual gear is a nightmare. It is stiff and sticky as if there were no lubricants inside. I know it's a new car, but the tightness is a killer for, say, a lady driver. I did have some reservations in shoving and yanking the gears, they're just not well-oiled at all.\n",

The luxurious interior grasps the onlooker into its beauty. With the comparisons now being held all over the world with the Honda Civic reborn, the corolla has outdone itself by enhancing in stability, power & comfort leaving behind the civic for the first time! Now with its triptronic gear & cruise control, it excels all the other cars in its price range. The rear of the vehicle, although highly similar to the previous corolla, still continues to be an icon of style. When i first saw the corolla cruisetronic, i was a littil bit disappointed because of its drastic similarity to the previous corolla, but i gained respect for it in time becuase of the high quality drive it has & its edges & cuts giving it a sporty touch. Toyota has again given its engine a sound that amazes people in acceleration. According to my opinion, if u can afford to buy a cruisetronic, go ahead! Enjoy.\n",

It was strange as in the US prices of cars were falling and here in Pak it was going up.The car came with NO balancing of tyres and no alignment. I had to pay Rs1000 from my own pocket on this, in retrospect I should have given the dealership a piece of my mind rather than the cash.The trunk too did not work well, the sales guy kept claiming it was a \"feature\" and not a bug. Got it fixed later by the dealership though. Seems honda has major quality issues in Pakistan, the founding Japaneses honda will surely be turning in his grave (I assume he's dead by now)!GOOD:1. Nice looks. Much better than the retard corolla2. ABS brakes3. Good economy, get anywhere from 10-13 km / liter (and i drive a little on the fast side)4. Decent accelerationBAD:1.

            "I have had a Baleno since 2004. Before this I used to own a Suzuki FX. Given my experience with the FX, the Baleno came as quite a surprise because before purchasing the Baleno I had come to the conclusion that Suzuki did not know how to manufacture a decent car.If you sit in an Alto or a Cultus or FX for that matter, they seem to share quite a few common driving characteristics.The Baleno however, is a different beast altogether. This car drives more like a Toyota (people may disagree). This is my fifth year with the car and it has not given me any trouble. I have only done the regular maintenance that is required for all cars. The car also has an excellent Factory fitted CNG kit which gives great mileage both in and out of the city. Even today when I think about getting another used car I feel that there is no car out there with such a good balance of features and performance at the price it is currently available for. About the only downside is the brand issue. A Suzuki, no matter how good, can never be a Honda or a Toyota.\n",

            "On whole Corolla is a very nice car and the new model is having  very refreshing look compared to the old one and comfortable too.Its comfort,looks,power,performance are so impressive that it can flatter anybody to fall in love with it.The Toyota engine gives you the confidence that it can take you anywhere in the world without giving a second thought and resale is also superb.Owning this car is like owning a sports car if you get sporty air spoiler fitted and cruise on highway which it can easily ask you to cross a speed of 140kmpl above that.\n",

            "Posted by SAVAK on Jun 05, 2009\n",
            "Mehran is one of the most successful model of Suzuki. Its a car that is mostly seen on Pakistan roads. Almost 70 percent of the car is manufactured in Pakistan. Why this car is very popular and successful? Well, in 800 cc category , for a very long time , Mehran was the only choice and affordable too to middle class.Still not too many options available when it comes to 800 cc category. There are some negatives in Mehran too. Its interior and exterior is of poor quality and deteriorates quickly. Suspension , gears , brakes , in fact almost all the part wear out quickly. Doors , locks and seats are very pathetic.THe ride is quite bumpy when driving on coarse paths. Yes , it has a low maintenance expenditure. Plus good support country wide.In the price range of Mehran , people are left with nothing but Mehran. Thats the success point of Suzuki Mehran in my view.\n",
